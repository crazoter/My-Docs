quick review question for You we talked about unsupervised Learning which is the learning setting Where you give the algorithm a ton of Data and just ask it to find structure In the data for us of the following four Examples which ones which of these four Do you think would be an unsupervised Learning out algorithm as opposed to a Supervised learning problem for each of The four check boxes on the Left check The ones or which you think of Unsupervised learning algorithm would be Appropriate and then click the button on The lower right to check your answer so When the video pauses please answer the Question on the slide so hopefully Remember the spam filter problem if you Have labeled data you know with of spam And non-spam email we treat this as a Supervised learning problem the new Story example that's exactly the Google News example that we saw in this video We saw how you can use a clustering Algorithm to cluster news articles Together so that's unsurprising learning The market segmentation example I talked A little bit earlier do that as an Unsupervised learning problem because I'm just going to give my From data and ask you to discover market Segments automatically and the final Example diabetes well that's actually Just like our breast cancer example from The last video Only instead of you know good and bad Cancer tumors or benign and malignant Tumors we instead have have diabetes or Not and so we will use that as a Supervised we will solve that as a Supervised learning problem just like we Did for the breast tumor data so that's It for unsupervised learning and in the Next video we'll delve more into Specific learning algorithms and start To talk about just how these algorithms Work and how we can how you can go about Implementing them

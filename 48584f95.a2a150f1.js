By the story's own logic, the spell is broken when the spell's medium dies, and thus nothing good should happen; in fact, nothing at all should happen.

There is zero explanation, zero foreshadowing, zero anything; it just happens. How? Why? There is no explanation. For all I know, this could just be a dream that the protagonist is having while he is bleeding out in the real world. And that is why I find it all so nonsensical and stupid.

I've been trying to figure out what is the best way to consolidate information during my time in NUS as it would be such a waste if I forget what I learn in university say a few years down the road (and also because I want to maximize time). To that end I have tried using Google Docs, mindmaps using diagrams.net, Anki and Latex cheatsheets as mediums of consolidating information. However, all of these methods are unsatisfactory in some way or another. 

When my friend Evan introduced me to Docusaurus, I thought I might as well try it out for a few reasons:
1. It's easy to setup and use
2. It supports math equations
3. I like the layout
4. It's got a search feature
5. It can help someone who is also struggling to understand a concept I once struggled to understand

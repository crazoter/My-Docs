This is usually at least a 7, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have even bothered to pick up the manga (unless I read a highly rated manga and believe it to be overrated)</li><li><strong>Bonus score:</strong> wrapped in brackets, -2 to 5.

Manga with +2 onwards are manga that I believe are worth recommending to others (if they don&#x27;t mind the negative points brought up)</li><li>3 - Read it!!! The kind where you think back about when you read it and it still warms your heart / makes you want to re-read </li><li>4 - Must read, the kind where you draw inspiration from the manga or are reminded of the manga in your life every now and then</li><li>5 - Must read, if you&#x27;re prepared to become addicted to it. The kind where you&#x27;re so attached to the characters you start producing/consuming fanfic/art/doujinshi, or just are crazy over the manga in general</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>Manga are presented in ascending order of their quality score.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="tidbits"></a>Tidbits<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#tidbits" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Some manga are kinda unforgettable, and then some have this recurring joke or outstanding thing (good ones have multiple) that makes you immediately know what manga you&#x27;re talking about when you mention it.

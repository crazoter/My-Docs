### Database Management Systems (DBMS)
* Data Independence
* Efficient Data access
* Data integrity & security
* Transaction Management
* Query language
* Database design
* Database programming
* **Data model**: used by DBMS, defined by user for querying the data
* **Schema**: Description of the data model
* **Schema instance**: Content of the DB at a specific time
* **Relational Model (RDBMS)**: Microsoft SQL, SAP, MySQL, SQLite
  * Data modeled using **relations** (i.e. tables)
  * Each relation defined by **relation schema**, and a relation is a set of tuples
    * Relation schema: (attributes, data constraints, domain constraints)
      * e.g. (id: int, name: text, birthDate: date)
      * Attribute: Column name
        * Must be a value in domain or null
      * Domain: datatype
      * Data constraints: e.g. non null, unique etc
        * (Data) Integrity Constraint: Specified with schema, ensure relation instance is *legal*
          * Domain constraints (datatype)
          * Key constraints
            * Non-null
            * **Superkey**: combination of attributes(columns) that uniquely identifies each tuple
            * **Key**: smallest combination of attributes that uniquely identifies each tuple
            * **Candidate Key**: possible keys
            * **Primary key** (PK): key chosen to uniquely ID each tuple
            * **Foreign key** (FK): attribute (or set of attributes) that refer to the PK of another relation
              * Must either refer to a valid PK or be set to NULL
              * FK constraints are known as **referential integrity constraints**
          * Foreign key constraints (FK must exist if set)
          * Other data constraints
    * Each row in a relation is a tuple/record has one component per attribute
    * A **relational database schema**: collection of relation schemas + data constraints
    * Relation (relation instance): A table populated with data
    * Relational database (database instance): collection of tables
* Object-relational model: Postgres

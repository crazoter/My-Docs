#### [Unix](http://linuxcommand.org)
* `/var/`: "variable" files, usually contain logs e.g. `/var/log`
* Analysing processes
  * `ps`
  * `lsof` (list of files (incl. devices & net sockets))
    * `-p [pid]`
    * `-i`: idk, prof just rambled
    * `+d`: for a particular dir
    * `+D`: for a dir, recursive
* Databases
  * User: `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, Group: `/etc/group`
* [File permissions](http://www.filepermissions.com/file-permissions-index)
  ```       
    Displayed syntax:
          owner's   owner's
          usr       grp       all  
    [-|d] rw[x|s|S] rw[x|s|S] rwx[t|T]
          0-7       0-7       0-7

    [-|d]:      [file | dir]
    [x|s|S]:    [exe | SUID set | SUID set, but user triad cannot exe]
    [x|s|S]:    [exe | SGID set | SGID set, but group triad cannot exe]
    [t|T]:      [Sticky bit set | Sticky Bit set, but other triads cannot exe]

    * SUID / SGID
    SUID or SGID can be set to elevate permissions for execution. 
    A SETUID or SETGID binary is executed respectively whilst the command is executed on the document in question.
    Usually an SUID or SGID is required where users need elevated privileges and do not have admin or root access.

    * Sticky Bit ensures only the owner/root can edit & delete the file/dir.

    * Chmod octal (4 groups of 3 bits):
    [SUID 4][SGID 2][Sticky 1] rws rws rws
  ```
  * `setuid`: change process' user ID to file owner
  * `setgid`: change process' user ID to group owner

* `find / -uid [uid] -perm [prefix][perm] -ls`
  * `/`: root dir
  * [[prefix]](https://askubuntu.com/questions/532952/what-does-perm-4000-o-perm-2000): `None`: Exact perms. `-`: All specified perms are set. `/` Any specified perms are set.
  * `[perm]`: See File permissions above.
  * `-ls`: list files found
* `man [section] cmd`: but nowadays just google
  * `[section]`: `1`: shell cmds `2`: syscalls `3`: lib calls `4`: special files `5`: file formats

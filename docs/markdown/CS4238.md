---

### Week 1
#### [Unix](http://linuxcommand.org)
* `/var/`: "variable" files, usually contain logs e.g. `/var/log`
* Analysing processes
  * `ps`
  * `lsof` (list of files (incl. devices & net sockets))
    * `-p [pid]`
    * `-i`: idk, prof just rambled
    * `+d`: for a particular dir
    * `+D`: for a dir, recursive
* Databases
  * User: `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, Group: `/etc/group`
* [File permissions](http://www.filepermissions.com/file-permissions-index)
  ```       
    Displayed syntax:
          owner's   owner's
          usr       grp       all  
    [-|d] rw[x|s|S] rw[x|s|S] rwx[t|T]
          0-7       0-7       0-7

    [-|d]:      [file | dir]
    [x|s|S]:    [exe | SUID set | SUID set, but user triad cannot exe]
    [x|s|S]:    [exe | SGID set | SGID set, but group triad cannot exe]
    [t|T]:      [Sticky bit set | Sticky Bit set, but other triads cannot exe]

    * SUID / SGID
    SUID or SGID can be set to elevate permissions for execution. 
    A SETUID or SETGID binary is executed respectively whilst the command is executed on the document in question.
    Usually an SUID or SGID is required where users need elevated privileges and do not have admin or root access.

    * Sticky Bit ensures only the owner/root can edit & delete the file/dir.

    * Chmod octal (4 groups of 3 bits):
    [SUID 4][SGID 2][Sticky 1] rws rws rws
  ```
  * `setuid`: change process' user ID to file owner
  * `setgid`: change process' user ID to group owner

* `find / -uid [uid] -perm [prefix][perm] -ls`
  * `/`: root dir
  * [[prefix]](https://askubuntu.com/questions/532952/what-does-perm-4000-o-perm-2000): `None`: Exact perms. `-`: All specified perms are set. `/` Any specified perms are set.
  * `[perm]`: See File permissions above.
  * `-ls`: list files found
* `man [section] cmd`: but nowadays just google
  * `[section]`: `1`: shell cmds `2`: syscalls `3`: lib calls `4`: special files `5`: file formats

### Week 2
* Highlights for TCP:
  * Src port, Dst port, Seq #, ACK, RST, SYN, FIN
  * ISN: Initial Sequence Num
  * Example by prof has nth to do with TCP layer lmao he talks about IP spoofing and overtaking the connection after DOSing Alice
* Highlights of IP:
  * Identification, Fragment Offset, TTL, Protocol, Src IP Addr (spoof), Don't Fragment bit, More Fragment bit (more fragments incoming if set)
    * ID: Identifies the packet
    * Fragment Offset: Fragment position during reassembly
  * Local: 127.0.0.1, Private: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12 (16.0.0-31.255.255), 192.168.0.0/16, Auto-IP: 169.254.1.0 - 169.254.254.255 (when DHCP unavailable)
* ICMP: TCP/UDP layer
  * Type, Code
* NAT: Map Private to public IP
* Firewalls: Network/IP Layer (Traditional packet filters, stateful packet filters, proxy-based firewalls). Filters check headers only
  * Usually block ICMP
* Network-based IDS: real-time detection, also check if packet payload matches application
* MAC address: sometimes can tell infrastructure from MAC. Not reliable because can be spoofed
* traceroute (Unix UDP), tracert (Win ICMP), tcptraceroute, tctrace
* Common Network Services: FTP (21), SSH (22), Telnet (23), HTTP (80), rlogin (513), rsh (rm shell 514), rcp, dns (53), nfs (2049), x windows (6000), ipp (ntwk printer 631)
  * SSH: `systemctl {start | enable | reload} ssh`
  * Apache: `systemctl start apache`, a2enmod, a2dismod
* Manual network config:
  * `ifdown <network-device>`, Set network via `/etc/network/interfaces`, then `ifup <network-device>`
  * Setup with DHCP: `auto lo \n iface lo inet loopback \n auto eth0 \n iface eth0 inet dhcp`
  * `ifconfig`: check, start, stop network interfaces
    * List: `ifconfig` (up only) `ifconfig -a / ip addr show` (all), `ifconfig eth0 / ip addr show eth0` (a specific interface), `ip -4|-6 addr show` (IPv4/IPv6 only)
    * Start/Stop: `ifconfig eth0 {down | up}` or `ip link set eth0 {down | up}`
  * Troubleshoot: Verify gateway, DNS server can be `ping`ed, check domain name resolved with `nslookup`
  * `nc ip_addr port`: see if server can be connected to via port
  * `route -n` = `ip route show`
  * `route add default gw <ip-addr>` = `ip route add default via <ip-addr>`
  * DNS: `nslookup`, `dig`, `host`
    * DNS records 
    * Zone transfer (usually disabled) 
      * w/ nslookup: `nslookup ; server [target-name-server] ; set type=any ; ls -d [target-domain]`
      * w/ dig: `dig @[target-name-server] [target-domain] -t AXFR`
    * Web-based DNS recon: ViewDNS.info, Central Ops, G Suite Toolbox's Dig
    * Countermeasure: Allow zone transfer only between pri & sec name servers
    * Develop split-horizon/split-view/split-brain DNS
  * Kali Linux tools
    * theHarvester (email addrs), Maltego, Netcraft, Centralops, Shodan (IoT), Kali NetHunter
* VirtualBox
  * [Networking Modes](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html)
    * VMs don't need to talk to each other: NAT
    * Else, VMs part of host network: Bridged
    * Else, VMs cannot talk to host: Internal
    * Else: If VMs can access internet (NAT Network) or cannot (Host-only)
* Compliance frameworks
  * Kill chain: Recon, Weapon, Delivery, Exploit, Install, Control, Actions
  * MITRE, PTES, OSSTM, OWASP, PCI DSS
* Recon: profile target
  * Low-Tech: Dumpster diving, Social engineering, Spoofing, Spam, Phishing, Physical break-in
  * Google Hacking
    * Exact: `"exact search"`, Number ranges: `1..10`, info: `info:url`, `site:[domain]`, `link:[page]`, word in title: `intitle[terms]` (e.g. `site:xxx intitle="index of"`), `related:[site]`, `cache[site]`, `filetype:suffix`, not (-), plus (+), `inurl:wp-login.php` 
    * inurl examples: `inurl:<domain-suffix>/[administrator|admin][password|user|login]`, `inurl:view/index.[shtml|html]` (cam), `inurl:viewer_index/index.[shtml|html]` (cam)
    * Google Hacking Database GHDB, Johnny Long's books "Google Hacking for Pen Testers"
    * Google cache, archive wayback machine
    * Metagoofil (metadata for public docs)
    * whois: 23% correct name and physical addr, 29% fake info
      * validation obligation on reigstras
    * OSINT (open source intelligence; info from freely-accessible sources)
  * Attackers' knowledge:
    * Phone #, Domain names, IP Addr, servers, tech contact info, people info
    * After scan: IP addr, network topo, list of open ports on live hosts, list of services & versions, OS types of live hosts, ports open through firewalls

### Week 3
  * War driving ("drive-by"): find wireless APs 
    * Attacks: active scanning, passive sniffing, forcing deauth
    * Defence: privacy in ESSID, wireless security protocols, VPN, detection
  * War dialing:
    * Look for modems in target networks
  * Network mapping: gain knowledge of target network topology
    * nmap ping (find live hosts using ICMP) `nmap -sP; | -sn` (no port scan) in newer nmap. Can use Zenmap for GUI
    * traceroute (exploit ttl & icmp TLE notif)
    * Defences: 
      * block icmp with firewall (disable ping)
      * filter ICMP TLE messages leaving network (hinder traceroute)
      * Check open ports: `netstat -na | grep "LISTENING"` / `lsof -i` and closed unused ports
      * keep sys patched (may not be easy to patch)
      * scan sys/network periodically (find vuln before attackers do)
        * ensure it's safe to scan
        * will DoS tests crash machines?
        * will password tests lock out legit users?
    * port scanning: find active services of server (65,536 possible TCP/UDP ports)
      * Scan: `nmap [--help] [-A] [-sT|-sS|-sA|-sF|-sX|-sN] [-oN|-oX|-oS|-oG <file>] [--packet-trace] [-v|-vv] [--reason] [-sV] [-T<0-5>] [-b ftp_relay] [-sI zombie[:probeport]] ip_addr` 
        * `-A`: Enable OS & version detection
        * `-sT`: Scan by Connection: Can be blocked by firewall, can be logged
        * `-sS`: SYN Scan. [Svr Response](https://nmap.org/book/synscan.html):
          * SYN/ACK = port open
          * RST = port closed
          * None w/ retransmit or ICMP unreachable = filtered
        * `-sA`: ACK scan (bypass firewall that blocks incoming connections, may use common source port numbers)
        * `-sF`: FIN scan, `-sX`: Xmas tree (all flags set), `-sN`: Null scan (no flags)
      * `-oN|-oX|-oS|-oG <file>`: Output as normal/XML/skript kiddie/grepable to filename
      * `--packet-trace`: show packets sent and received
      * `-v`: verbosity
      * `--reason`: show reason why port is in a particular state
      * `-sV`: Identify services using non-standard port numbers
      * `-T<0-5>`: 0 slowest, 5 fastest
      * `-b ftp_relay`: **Bounce/file-relaying/FTP-forwarding** feature on old FTP servers, allow you to port scan using FTP server as proxy. If FTP server has access to internal hosts, can bypass firewall. Change `ftp_relay` with FTP server IP
      * `-sI zombie[:probeport]`: **Idle scan**: Target server non-responsive. If we can connect to a machine that is: 1. Able to talk to target 2. Is idle 3. Uses predictable (global) IP identification values (IP packet ID val), We can: 1. connect to zombie and get IP ID, 2. Ping target on port, spoofing our IP as the zombie. 3. Target talks to zombie and zombie replies, incrementing their IP ID. 4. Talk to zombie again and check if IP ID has jumped
* Vulnerability
  * Weakness that can be exploited by an attacker to do unauthorized things 
  * Refer to CVE (maintained by MITRE)
  * Exploit databases (older vulns for learning):
    * exploit database, rapid7, securityfocus
  * Zero-day: unknown exploit (Day-zero: vendor finds out).
  * Lifecycle: Vuln found, Exploit in wild, Discovered (by vendor), public disclosure, anti-virus signatures released, patch released, patch deployed
    * zero-day + follow-on attacks between exploit released and patch deployed
  * Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) for assessing severity of vulns
    * 3 metric groups: Base, temporal, environmental
    * Base metric: 0 - 10
  * Vulnerability Scanning tools can be used for:
    * common config errors
    * default config weaknesses
    * well-known sys vulnerabilities
    * Useful between vulnerability discovered - Patch deployment
    * General structure: User config tool - Scanning engine + vuln. DB on targets - knowledge base of current scan - report generation based on results
    * Free examples: Nessus / OpenVAS / Attack Tool Kit
      * Plugins &pre-built policies can be installed from tenable
      * Create Nessus policies based on policy templates (e.g. basic network scan), specify policy targets & scanning options, launch policy and check result
    * Antivirus vs vulnerability scanner
      * Differences: Goal, scope of detection, monitoring agent, info examined (servers), reference data, output (computer infected / service affected)
    * Useful for pentesting and compliance checking
    * Can vulnerability testing scan on Hackerdemia LiveCD (dl from hackingdojo) on another VM
  * Limitations
    * Only check for known vulnerabilities (zero days not accounted for)
    * Only check specified targets
    * Only snapshot (Nessus "Live Results": offline vulnerability assessment with every plugin update)

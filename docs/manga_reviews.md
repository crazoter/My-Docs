title: Manga Reviews
---
Started a page on manga so I can keep track of what I read. Note that this list only contains manga I've read *after* 2020 Oct

## Manga personal preferences
* I like reading comedy 
* I have a tendency to read romcoms
* I prefer some realism

## Quality Scoring System

Manga on this page are scored by a base score plus a bonus score. As such, the total score can range from 1 to 15.

* **Base score**: 1-10 out of 10, your normal review score. This is usually at least a 7, otherwise I wouldn't have even bothered to pick up the manga (unless I read a highly rated manga and believe it to be overrated)
* **Bonus score:** wrapped in brackets, -2 to 5. I only add the manga which I believe can be considered readable on this page, so this bonus score is really meant to distinguish the "really good" and the "exceptionally good".
  * The possible scores are as follows:
    * -2 - Only worth reading if you are addicted to the genre and need something to nibble on
    * -1 - Umm... The kind of manga where I'm kind of on the fence, which means you can do without reading it
    * 0 - Worth reading, but kind of forgettable... 
    * 1 - Highly worth reading, but some parts are kind of unsatisfactory, or I just don't feel attached to it for some unexplained reason
    * 2 - Definitely worth reading, I really liked it. Manga with +2 onwards are manga that I believe are worth recommending to others (if they don't mind the negative points brought up)
    * 3 - Read it!!! The kind where you think back about when you read it and it still warms your heart / makes you want to re-read 
    * 4 - Must read, the kind where you draw inspiration from the manga or are reminded of the manga in your life every now and then
    * 5 - Must read, if you're prepared to become addicted to it. The kind where you're so attached to the characters you start producing/consuming fanfic/art/doujinshi, or just are crazy over the manga in general

Manga are presented in ascending order of their quality score.

## Tidbits

Some manga are kinda unforgettable, and then some have this recurring joke or outstanding thing (good ones have multiple) that makes you immediately know what manga you're talking about when you mention it. I generally include the tidbit that most reminds me of the manga if I like it. This may contain spoilers for the manga, so readers beware.

## Reviews of Completed Series

Below is the list of manga that have finished.

### Jitsu Wa Watashi Wa (Quality Score: 9/10 (+1))
* Synopsis: A high-school love story between a human and a vampire; expect lots of other weird entities too.
* Genre: romcom (funny & touching, focus on friendships, love, discrimination and long-term perserverance)
* Setting: high school
* Chapters: 196
* +ve Points:
    * Many funny moments to the point where some serious moments get interrupted by funny moments
    * The manga has a lot of twists and turns which keep it fresh (caveat is you know everything is going to be okay in the end)
    * A lot of highs and lows, the emotional parts of the manga are good 
    * Doesn't only focus on the MC, also wraps up (most) loose ends for other side characters and closes the story relatively well
    * Big-brain author pulling off foreshadowing and time-travel
* Points:
    * Art style is a little unlike other manga
    * Quite a lot of fanservice (there is literally a character called the "Charismatic Pervert")
    * Some parts have excessive fanservice
* -ve Points:
    * Some parts can be a bit too random / weird
    * May have to trudge through the first few chapters
    * Some parts can be a bit too idealistic
    * There's quite a lot of filler
    * [SPOILER] MC gets a harem forced on him (arbitrary reasons as to why so many like him)
    * The way tension is defused in the manga can get abit repetitive over time
    * Some side characters don't really get fleshed out, can feel a little shallow at times
    * [SPOILER] Shirou literally gets zero character development
    * Has a tendency to flesh out a character in 1 arc, then just toss them aside for the rest of the story
* Should you read it: Some parts feel a little draggy, but in general very worth reading; truly a rollercoaster of emotions.
* Will I re-read it: Probably not, there's too many fillers, but some parts are legit hilarous
* **Tidbit**: ( ⚆ _ ⚆ ) ( ⚆ _ ⚆ ) when they find out what sucking blood really means to vampires

### Tomo-chan wa Onnanoko (Quality Score: 10/10 (+0))
* Synopsis: A love story between a tomboy and a guy who are both ridiculously athletic
* Genre: romcom
* Chapters: 956, but most of them are just 1 page. Effectively ~60-65 chapters
* +ve points:
    * There's a lot more "show but don't tell" moments than other manga, partially because of it's structure
    * There are some really (rare) funny parts 471 472 505 793 801 832 868
* -ve points:
    * Clicking through the pages can be a pain
* Should you read it: Hm. Thinking back to this manga now I don't really have any outstanding memories of it. Don't get me wrong, it's got sweet and funny moments and it was kinda refreshing to read with its 1 page structure, but it's not terribly memorable. 
* Tidbit: This manga doesn't have a tidbit because I honestly don't remember any outstanding moments (aside from the confessions and the part where someone got angry)

### Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet (Quality Score: 10/10 (+4))
* Synopsis: A love story between two people from opposing countries in the same school.
* Genre: romcom (cute, sweet, funny, focus on friendships, love, discrimination and perserverance)
* Setting: high school
* Chapters: 119
* +ve points:
    * Very good pacing and progression of the story, length feels just right
    * Many funny, cute and sweet moments
    * (Most) characters are fleshed out and have depth
    * While it is still idealistic (what do you expect from a romcom), it's much more grounded most than other romcoms
    * Pretty good closure: Doesn't just end at the school level, but story also resolves conflict at a country-level and progresses all the way to marriage
* Points
    * A lot of fanservice
    * Content Warning: 1st chapter has abit of a rape-ish situation (this is the only time this happens throughout the manga so can relax)
* -ve points:
    * Some characters just there for the comic relief after their character arc (if they get one), wasted potential
    * Some characters have unfulfilling/silly endings
* Should you read it: Very highly recommended. It is very satisfying to read from start to finish and I still get goosebumps thinking about it. Again, very good pacing. Absolutely outstanding work.
* Will I re-read it: Maybe
* **Tidbit**: Honestly the highlight is that fact that the two main characters keep having to pretend to be something they aren't makes this such an entertaining read

## Reviews of Ongoing Monthlies / Irregular Series

Below is the list of manga that are still ongoing.

### Wotakoi (Quality Score: 9/10 (+0))
* Synopsis: otakus
* Genre: slice-of-life, romcom (focus on romance)
* Setting: salarymen / women, working life
* Release rate: Monthly
* Read until: Ch 63
* Points: 
    * Plot is just all about the 6 main characters
    * Mostly on sweet / romance moments rather than "HAHAHA" funny (although there are some funny moments)
    * Some chapters (esp. the earlier ones) make a lot of references to popular otaku culture
      * These are usually explained in TL notes
      * That said, if you are their kind of person... you would actually enjoy these references
    * Limited drama and tribulations, if you're into that sort of thing
    * Abit cliche; all (initial) main characters are of different blood type groups 
* -ve points:
  * The otaku aspect gets a little stale after awhile, I'd prefer to see more facets of the characters (e.g. reactions to unexplored content for example)
    * Yeah as you might guess the plot isn't super deep but it does have some flitting food for thought moments
* Should you read it: If you like stories that give you diabetes and you enjoy reading about otakus hanging out
* **Tidbit**: Flat-chested Narumi

### The Undefeatable Swordsman (Quality Score: 9/10, (+?))
* Synopsis: MC is very badass
* Genre: manhwa, shounen
* Setting: Feudal times, Korea, martial arts, Taoism 
* Release rate: Irregular
* Read until: Ch38
* points:
  * The story still feels kinda young, it's only completed like maybe 1-2 story arcs
  * SPOILER-ISH: MC becomes pretty damn OP pretty quick, like maybe even abit too quick tbh
    * SPOILER-ISH: I'm honestly expecting the MC to fall to the dark side somewhere down the road because of how fast he is going
* Should you read it: It's still too early to draw conclusions on the quality of this manhwa. So far, so good.

### Oresama Teacher (Quality Score: 10/10 (+2*))
* Synopsis: Delinquent girl turns a new leaf (?) when she changes school 
* Genre: shojo, romcom (focus on comedy)
* Release rate: Irregular
* Read until: 155
* Fav chapter: probably 72 lol really made me burst out loud
* +ve points:
    * the facial expressions are on point and the humor is quite good
* points:
    * [SPOILER] I didn't expect her to slowly form a reverse harem lol.. Then again, this is a shojo
    * Don't expect in-depth romance. Any romance is usually touch & go, unrequited or just really close friendships kinda thing.
* Should you read it: I'd recommend it. It consistently delivers on the humor. The plot sometimes feels kinda shallow (e.g. everyone turns out to be a good guy in the end kinda vibes), and sometimes it's not too hard to guess the plot, but honestly it's pretty good.
* Other notes: I give this a +2 even though I'm not in the discord server (this manga is simply not popular enough to have an active server)
* **Tidbit**: Usa-chan Man!

### Hori-san to Miyamura-kun (Horimiya) (Quality Score: 10/10 (+3))
* Synopsis: A wholesome slice-of-life story with a loner and a popular girl and their friends
* Genre: slice-of-life / romcom (mostly slice of life with some sweet romantic moments)
* Setting: high-school / family
* Release rate: Monthly (irregular)
* Read until:
* Special Note: I come back to this manga every few years to catch up
* +ve points:
    * although it's called horimiya, everyone is involved in the slice-of-life manga (although they get the spotlight)
* points:
    * I call this slice-of-life because there are a lot of filler chapters, limited plot progression (yes you literally wait years for the plot to progress), but the characters and relationships can get pretty deep.
    * Horimiya actually involves their relationship with their family (in particular the Hori family) which can be kinda refreshing for a romcom
* -ve points:
    * some of the characters look too similar at the start so it's easy to mix up iura-kun
* Should you read it: Hmmm. I'd say yes if you want a manga to read and kinda just chill. It's got that calming / soothing vibe to it since a lot of the scenes are at the Hori household. I don't recommend getting too attached because of how slow it is.
* Disclaimer: That said, the story progresses very slowly (if ever) after ~ chapter 37 or so, hence I call it slice-of-life because you've probably retired by the time they graduate
* **Tidbit**: See spoiler below

>! Hori likes being submissive uh...

### Grand Blue (Quality Score: 10/10 (+4))
* Synopsis: A manga that about diving but is hardly about diving (and then jokes about that fact)
* Genre: comedy (funny, focus on friendships, there's some romance but it's not the focus imo)
* Release rate: Monthly (somewhat inconsistent)
* Read until: Ch 63
* +ve points:
    * One of the funniest (if not the funniest) manga I've ever read
    * It's got some serious moments too so it's not too bad but in general just non-stop funny
* Points:
    * Expect weird stuff to happen in Grand Blue, probably not for everyone
* -ve points:
    * Some parts feel abit too repetitive / dragged out / feels like the story is going nowhere
    * Some of the character faces look abit too similar
    * Unclear story direction after some point in the plot..?
* Should you read it: Must read!
* **Tidbit**: Oolong cha

### Kitsune Spirit (Quality Score: 10/10, (+3))

* Release rate: Weekly

* Points:
  * Some lewd moments
  * Like I said this can get dark quick
  * The chapters are a little short for a weekly

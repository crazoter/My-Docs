title: Manga Reviews
---
Started a page on manga so I can keep track of what I read. Note that this list only contains manga I've read *after* 2020 Oct

## Manga personal preferences
* I read manga during my free time to relax, so that kinda affects my manga choices. Stressful genres like horror are usually not my cup of tea.
* I like reading comedy 
* I have a tendency to read romcoms
* I like believable stories.
  * I prefer stories that [evoke secondary belief](https://dianetibert.com/2019/10/25/j-r-r-tolkien-evoking-secondary-belief); that is, given the story's fictional (or non-fictional) setting, the story and characters' actions should be reasonably believable
  * I'm not really a fan of plot armor or improbably idealistic outcomes; If a tragedy is more likely to happen in a story, I'd rather it happened as opposed to a sudden plot twist that made things all good again (although most stories tend to twist it to the latter). That said, I don't mind the happy endings... just make it more believable
  * I don't really like harems.

## Can you recommend a manga / manhwa for me to read?

Check the table of contents and start reading the reviews from the ones with the highest quality scores (the list is currently ordered in ascending order downwards). My all-time favourites when it comes to comedy is Grand Blue and when it comes to romcoms it's Kaguya Love is War. I don't have a favourite shounen series because that genre is saturated with good stuff.

## Quality Scoring System

Manga on this page are scored by a base score plus a bonus score. As such, the total score can range from 1 to 15.

* **Base score**: 1-10 out of 10, your normal review score. This is usually at least a 7, otherwise I wouldn't have even bothered to pick up the manga (unless I read a highly rated manga and believe it to be overrated)
* **Bonus score:** wrapped in brackets, -2 to 5. I only add the manga which I believe can be considered readable on this page, so this bonus score is really meant to distinguish the "really good" and the "exceptionally good".
  * The possible scores are as follows:
    * -2 - Only worth reading if you are addicted to the genre and need something to nibble on
    * -1 - Umm... The kind of manga where I'm kind of on the fence, which means you can do without reading it
    * 0 - Worth reading, but kind of forgettable... 
    * 1 - Highly worth reading, but some parts are kind of unsatisfactory, or I just don't feel attached to it for some unexplained reason
    * 2 - Definitely worth reading, I really liked it. Manga with +2 onwards are manga that I believe can be safely recommended to others who like the genre (if they don't mind the negative points brought up)
    * 3 - Read it!!! The kind where you think back about when you read it and it still warms your heart / makes you want to re-read 
    * 4 - Must read, the kind where you draw inspiration from the manga or are reminded of the manga in your life every now and then
    * 5 - Must read, if you're prepared to become addicted to it. The kind where you're so attached to the characters you start reading the original novel, or related fanfic/art/doujinshi.

Manga are presented in ascending order of their quality score.

## Tidbits

Some manga are kinda unforgettable, and then some have this recurring joke or outstanding thing (good ones have multiple) that makes you immediately know what manga you're talking about when you mention it. I generally include the tidbit that most reminds me of the manga if I like it. This may contain spoilers for the manga, so readers beware.

## Reviews of Completed Series

Below is the list of manga that have finished.

### Tomo-chan wa Onnanoko (Romcom) (Score: 10/10 (+0))
* Synopsis: A love story between a tomboy and a guy who are both ridiculously athletic
* Genre: romcom
* Chapters: 956, but most of them are just 1 page. Effectively ~60-65 chapters
* +ve points:
    * There's a lot more "show but don't tell" moments than other manga, partially because of it's structure
    * There are some really (rare) funny parts 471 472 505 793 801 832 868
* -ve points:
    * Clicking through the pages can be a pain
* Should you read it: Hm. Thinking back to this manga now I don't really have any outstanding memories of it. Don't get me wrong, it's got sweet and funny moments and it was kinda refreshing to read with its 1 page structure, but it's not terribly memorable. 
* Tidbit: This manga doesn't have a tidbit because I honestly don't remember any outstanding moments (aside from the confessions and the part where someone got angry)
  
### Jitsu Wa Watashi Wa (Romcom) (Score: 9/10 (+2))
* Synopsis: A high-school love story between a human and a vampire; expect lots of other weird entities too.
* Genre: romcom (funny & touching, focus on comedy, friendships, love, discrimination and long-term perserverance)
* Setting: high school
* Chapters: 196
* +ve Points:
    * Many funny moments to the point where some serious moments get interrupted by funny moments
    * The manga has a lot of twists and turns which keep it fresh (caveat is you know everything is going to be okay in the end)
    * A lot of highs and lows, the emotional parts of the manga are good 
    * Doesn't only focus on the MC, also wraps up (most) loose ends for other side characters and closes the story relatively well
    * Big-brain author pulling off foreshadowing and time-travel
* Points:
    * Art style is a little unlike other manga
    * Quite a lot of fanservice (there is literally a character called the "Charismatic Pervert")
    * Some parts have excessive fanservice
* -ve Points:
    * Some parts can be a bit too random / weird
    * May have to trudge through the first few chapters
    * Some parts can be a bit too idealistic
    * There's quite a lot of filler
    * [SPOILER] MC gets a harem forced on him (arbitrary reasons as to why so many like him... seriously, *why*?)
    * The way tension is defused in the manga can get abit repetitive over time
    * Some side characters don't really get fleshed out, can feel a little shallow at times
    * [SPOILER] Shirou literally gets zero character development which is honestly such a waste of potential
    * Has a tendency to flesh out a character in 1 arc, then just toss them aside for the rest of the story
* Should you read it: Some parts feel a little draggy, but in general worth reading; truly a rollercoaster of emotions.
* Will I re-read it: Probably not, there's too many fillers, but some parts are legit hilarous
* **Tidbit**: ( ⚆ _ ⚆ ) ( ⚆ _ ⚆ ) when they find out what sucking blood really means to vampires

### Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet (Romcom) (Score: 10/10 (+4))
* Synopsis: A love story between two people from opposing countries in the same school.
* Genre: romcom (cute, sweet, funny, focus on friendships, love, discrimination and perserverance)
* Setting: high school
* Chapters: 119
* +ve points:
    * Very good pacing and progression of the story, length feels just right
    * Many funny, cute and sweet moments
    * (Most) characters are fleshed out and have depth
    * While it is still idealistic (what do you expect from a romcom), it's much more grounded most than other romcoms
    * Pretty good closure: Doesn't just end at the school level, but story also resolves conflict at a country-level and progresses all the way to marriage
* Points
    * A lot of fanservice
    * Content Warning: 1st chapter has abit of a rape-ish situation (this is the only time this happens throughout the manga so can relax)
* -ve points:
    * Some characters just there for the comic relief after their character arc (if they get one), wasted potential
    * Some characters have unfulfilling/silly endings
* Should you read it: Very highly recommended. It is very satisfying to read from start to finish and I still get goosebumps thinking about it. Again, very good pacing. Absolutely outstanding work.
* Will I re-read it: Maybe
* **Tidbit**: Honestly the highlight is that fact that the two main characters keep having to pretend to be something they aren't makes this such an entertaining read

## Reviews of Ongoing Monthlies / Irregular Series

Below is the list of manga that are still ongoing, but only updated monthly / irregularly. 

### Bakarina (Harem Comedy) (Score: 8/10, (+1))
* Synopsis: "My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!" That's right, the name of the manga is the synopsis
* Genre: comedy, harem
* Release rate: Weekly
* Read until: In progress
* points:
    * Very dense MC
    * Everyone noteworthy will fall hopelessly in love with the MC and devote their lives to her. This could get dry real quick
* Should you read it: It's a nice manga and the anime was quite well-done. The main appeal of this manga is that it loves to pull off ironic situations. The harem thing gets stale quite easily though and the characters are currently kinda skin-deep in general. There's some tension when characters get into potentially dangerous situations, but with this kind of manga you don't have to worry too much.
* **Tidbit**: Did you know the pet name for this manga is Bakarina? It is quite easy to guess why..

### Wotakoi (Josei slice-of-life romcom) (Score: 9/10 (+0))
* Synopsis: otakus
* Genre: slice-of-life, romcom (focus on romance)
* Setting: salarymen / women, working life
* Release rate: Monthly
* Read until: Ch 63
* Points: 
    * Plot is all about the 6 main characters
    * Mostly on sweet / romance moments rather than "HAHAHA" funny (although there are some funny moments)
    * Some chapters (esp. the earlier ones) make a lot of references to popular otaku culture
      * These are usually explained in TL notes
      * That said, if you are their kind of person... you would actually enjoy these references
    * Limited drama and tribulations, if you're into that sort of thing
    * Abit cliche; all (initial) main characters are of different blood type groups 
* -ve points:
  * The otaku aspect gets a little stale after awhile, I'd prefer to see more facets of the characters (e.g. reactions to unexplored content for example)
    * Yeah as you might guess the plot isn't super deep but it does have some flitting food for thought moments
* Should you read it: If you like stories that give you diabetes and you enjoy reading about otakus hanging out
* **Tidbit**: Flat-chested Narumi

### Horimiya (Slice-of-life romcom) (Score: 9/10 (+1))
* Synopsis: A wholesome slice-of-life story with a loner and a popular girl and their friends
* Genre: slice-of-life / romcom (mostly slice of life with some sweet romantic moments)
* Setting: high-school / family
* Release rate: Monthly (irregular)
* Read until:
* Special Note: I come back to this manga every few years to catch up
* +ve points:
    * although it's called horimiya, everyone is involved in the slice-of-life manga (although main couple gets the spotlight)
* points:
    * I call this slice-of-life because there are a lot of filler chapters, limited plot progression (yes you *literally* wait irl years for the plot (if there is any) to progress), but the characters and relationships are fleshed out.
    * Horimiya actually involves their relationship with their family (in particular the Hori family) which can be kinda refreshing for a romcom
* -ve points:
    * some of the characters look too similar at the start so it's easy to mix up iura-kun
* Should you read it: Hmmm. I'd say yes if you want a manga to read and kinda just chill. It's got that calming / soothing vibe to it since a lot of the scenes are at the Hori household. I don't recommend getting too attached because of how slow it is.
* Disclaimer: That said, the story progresses very slowly (if ever) after ~ chapter 37 or so, hence I call it slice-of-life because you've probably retired by the time they graduate
* **Tidbit**: [SPOILER] Hori likes being submissive uh...

### Chitra (Isekai Reverse Harem) (Score: 9/10, (+1))
* Synopsis: Woman reborn in fantasy world and plays Civilization
* Genre: manhwa, isekai, reverse harem
* Release rate: Irregular
* Read until: Ch63
* points:
  * Reverse harem is strong in this manhwa
  * Sometimes feels like The Gamer with all the game pop-ups and gachapon
* Should you read it: It's not bad, but the update rate is a bit iffy..
* **Tidbit**: What does the rabbit eat?

### The Undefeatable Swordsman (Shonen) (Score: 9/10, (+2?))
* Synopsis: MC is very badass
* Genre: manhwa, shonen
* Setting: Feudal times, Korea, martial arts, Taoism 
* Release rate: Irregular
* Read until: Ch38
* points:
  * The story still feels kinda young, it's only completed like maybe 1-2 story arcs
  * SPOILER-ISH: MC becomes pretty damn OP pretty quick, like maybe even abit too quick tbh
    * SPOILER-ISH: I'm honestly expecting the MC to fall to the dark side somewhere down the road because of how fast he is going
* Should you read it: It's still too early to draw conclusions on the quality of this manhwa as it's only at around 38 chapters. So far, so good.

### Oresama Teacher (Shojo Romcom) (Score: 10/10 (+3))
* Synopsis: Delinquent girl turns a new leaf (?) when she changes school 
* Genre: shojo, romcom (focus on comedy)
* Release rate: Irregular
* Read until: 155
* Fav chapter: probably 72 lol really made me burst out loud
* +ve points:
    * the facial expressions are on point and the humor is quite good
* points:
    * [SPOILER-ISH] I didn't expect her to slowly form a reverse harem lol.. Then again, this is a shojo
    * Don't expect in-depth romance. Any romance is usually touch & go, unrequited or just really close friendships kinda thing.
* Should you read it: I'd recommend it. It consistently delivers on the humor. The plot sometimes feels kinda shallow (e.g. everyone turns out to be a good guy in the end kinda vibes), and sometimes it's not too hard to guess the plot, but honestly it's pretty good.
* Other notes: I give this a +2 even though I'm not in a discord server dedicated to this manga (this manga is simply not popular enough to have an active server)
* **Tidbit**: Usa-chan Man!

### Grand Blue (Comedy) (Score: 10/10 (+4))
* Synopsis: A manga that is about diving but there is hardly any diving (and then proceeds to joke about that fact)
* Genre: comedy (funny, focus on friendships, there's some romance but it's not the focus imo)
* Release rate: Monthly (somewhat inconsistent)
* Read until: Ch 63
* +ve points:
    * One of the funniest (if not the funniest) manga I've ever read
    * It's got some serious moments too so it's not too bad but in general just non-stop funny
* Points:
    * Expect weird stuff to happen in Grand Blue, probably not for everyone
* -ve points:
    * Some parts feel abit too repetitive / dragged out / feels like the story is going nowhere
    * Some of the character faces look abit too similar
    * Unclear story direction after some point in the plot..?
* Should you read it: Must read!
* **Tidbit**: Oolong cha

## Reviews of Ongoing Weeklies Series

### The Stereotypical Life of a Reincarnated Lady (Romcom) (Score: 7/10, (-1))
* Synopsis: Woman reincarnates as noble lady
* Genre: romcom, manhwa
* Release rate: Weekly
* Read until: Ch 36
* Should you read it: I wouldn't really recommend it. So why is this manhwa on this list? I don't know. I just couldn't stop reading it to the end. It's not a *terrible* manhwa per se, but if you were to ask me what I liked about it, I wouldn't be able to give you an answer.

### That Girl is not just cute (romcom) (Score: 9/10, (+0))
* Synopsis: A love story between a really unlucky boy and a strong girl who protects him. Falling in love portion glossed over.
* Genre: romcom (cute, sweet, focus on friendships & romance)
* Release rate: Weekly
* Read until: Ch 85
* +ve points:
    * A lot of sweet and cute moments
* Should you read it: I would recommend it to people who like sweet manga and that slice-of-life BGR.
* **Tidbit**: Hachimatsu (  ´‿`)

### The Pharmarcy Where the Wolf Howls (josei romcom) (Score: 9/10, (+0?))
* Synopsis: Pharmacist meets shunned celebrity from her childhood
* Genre: romcom, josei, manhwa
* Release rate: Weekly
* Read until: 35
* Should you read it: There's quite a lot of drama in this manhwa (although it's not between the main ship), so if you're not into that sort of thing I wouldn't recommend this. There are some funny parts, but unfortunately I don't find it very memorable (largely because the manhwa is still in its early stages).

### We May Be An Inexperienced Couple But... (Seinen romcom) (Score: 9/10, (+2))
* Warning: M18+ content
* Synopsis: Married life with a lot of emphasis on doing the putting it in and taking it out at the start
* Genre: romcom, seinen, slice-of-life
* Release rate: Weekly
* Read until: 59
* Should you read it: Some parts are borderline hentai (even when censored), so if you're not into that sort of thing I don't recommend this at all. If you're okay with that sort of thing, it's a pretty sweet romance manga with decent story progression and sometimes talks about adult life stuff (that isn't necessarily M18). Not a lot of drama.

### Kitsune Spirit (Shonen romcom) (Score: 10/10, (+3))
* Synopsis: A married couple in a world with supernatural creatures
* Genre: romcom (equal parts sweet and funny), shounen (yes, shounen. You'll see why. This can get dark real quick)
* Release rate: Weekly
* Read until: 101
* Points:
  * Some lewd moments
  * Like I said this can get dark quick
  * The chapters are a little short for a weekly
  * Starts off as romcom and then becomes shounen before going back to being a romcom again
* Should you read it: Not gonna lie, the characters, setting and story is kinda refreshing.
* **Tidbit**: No citeable tidbit... but this pair is so cute~~~! e.g. Ch 99

### Mission: Yozakura Family (Shonen romcom) (Score: 10/10, (+3))
* Synopsis: You'll know after reading the first chapter haha (yes, it's a bit spoilerish to explain this)
* Genre: romcom, shonen
* Release rate: Weekly
* Read until: 58
* Points:
  * It follows your usual shounen manga storyline: MC meets new big bad, powers up, meets another new big bad and gets stronger etc. It's not boring, but just expect that sort of story.
  * The story's a little too skewed towards the success of the protagonists.
  * Gives me Hero Academia vibes.
  * Also gives me some Demon Slayer vibes. Death is a common topic in this manga.
* Should you read it: Yes. It's quite well-written. I like how the story progresses. Sure, sometimes when you read a chapter you get the "Oh, this chapter is going to be about elaborating about this guy's personality" and such but I think overall it's well put together.

### Kaguya-sama: Love is War (Seinen romcom) (Score: 10/10 (+5))
* Synopsis: high school life where two try to make the other confess
* Genre: romcom, seinen
* Release rate: Weekly
* Read until: 200+. Re-reading process suspended.
* Why you should read it: This is a masterclass in romcoms. Each character, even the side-characters, are involved in the story, common romcom tropes are toyed with and there is consistent plot progression. 10/10, 5/5.
* **Tidbit**: o kawaii koto~

### Cultivation Chat Group (Xianxia Comedy) (Score: 10/10 (+5))
* Synopsis: Cultivation and martial arts in a modern world
* Genre: Xianxia, shonen, comedy
* Release rate: Weekly
* Read until: Ch 263
* Why you should read it: It is very funny and it brings a smile to my face when I think about all the silly things that happens in this series. The beginning's a little slow (the intro is effectively 10 chapters of reading text messages) and the MC is just stupidly lucky (or unlucky?) but it's really good.
* **Tidbit**: There's way too many things that make this memorable.

## Read but didn't like

### Tonari No Kaibutsu-Kun
* Read until: 1st 2 chapters
* Relationship felt a little toxic

import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Started a page on manga so I can keep track of what I read. Note that this list only contains manga I've read *after* 2020 Oct.

## Manga personal preferences
* I read manga during my free time to relax, so that kinda affects my manga choices. Stressful genres like horror are usually not my cup of tea.
* I like reading comedy 
* I have a tendency to read romcoms
* I like believable stories.
  * I prefer stories that [evoke secondary belief](https://dianetibert.com/2019/10/25/j-r-r-tolkien-evoking-secondary-belief); that is, given the story's fictional (or non-fictional) setting, the story and characters' actions should be reasonably believable
  * I'm not really a fan of plot armor or improbably idealistic outcomes; If a tragedy is more likely to happen in a story, I'd rather it happened as opposed to a sudden plot twist that made things all good again (although most stories tend to twist it to the latter). I am aware that this is something that happens all the time in manga and manhwa, so I usually turn a blind eye to its occurence.
  * I don't really like harems, yuri or yaoi, even though they are not deal-breakers.
* I prefer certainty of continuation. I tend to avoid starting on series that are no longer being maintained (e.g. Vagabond). 
* I like plot progression / character development and I hate stagnation. I'd be dissatisfied if I read a few chapters in a row and come out thinking that the plot didn't progress / there was zero character development. That being said, it depends on the manga; I'd excuse a slice-of-life manga for pulling this stunt, but not an action manga.
  
## Can you recommend a manga / manhwa for me to read?

Check the table of contents and start reading the reviews from the ones with the highest quality scores. If they have the same bonus score, the manga that is more to the right is my preference. 

My all-time favourites when it comes to comedy is Grand Blue and when it comes to romcoms it's Kaguya Love is War. I don't have a favourite shounen/action series because that genre is saturated with good stuff.

## Quality Scoring System

Manga on this page are scored by a base score plus a bonus score. As such, the total score can range from 1 to 15.

* **Base score**: 1-10 out of 10. This is a subjective value based on how much I like the manga. This is usually at least a 7, otherwise I wouldn't have even bothered to pick up the manga (unless I read a highly rated manga and believe it to be overrated). 
* **Bonus score:** wrapped in brackets, -2 to 5. Each score correlates to the level of "must-read" that I associate with it (elaborated upon below). I only add the manga which I believe can be considered readable on this page, so this bonus score is really meant to distinguish the "really good" and the "exceptionally good".
  * The possible scores are as follows:
    * -2 - Don't bother reading anything -2 and below. They usually have some redeeming qualities (hence why I picked them up in the first place), but in general their quality makes it *not* worth reading
    * -1 - Umm... The kind of manga where I'm kind of on the fence, which means you can do without reading it
    * 0 - Manga that you can consider reading. Some are kind of forgettable and in my opinion skippable, while some are nice to read, but perhaps a little too shallow to be worth recommending to others.
    * 1 - Manga that can be considered somewhat worth reading. Manga in this list usually contain parts that I find unsatisfactory, or I just don't feel attached to the manga for some unexplained reason
    * 2 - Manga that I like and, more importantly, think others may like. Usually consists of manga that I currently follow (or had followed).
    * 3 - Manga which I think can be safely recommended to others. Usually of substantial quality in some way or another.
    * 4 - Manga which I think are, without doubt, worth reading if you like the genre.
    * 5 - Manga which I got addicted to. The kind where you're so attached to the characters you start reading the original novel, or related fanfic/art.
* **Loopholes**: There are some manga where the base score is exceptional, but the bonus score isn't very high (e.g. That Girl is not just cute). This is because even though I like the series, I recognize it's not really impactful.

Manga are presented in ascending order of their quality score.

## Tidbits

Some manga are kinda unforgettable, and then some have this recurring joke or outstanding thing (good ones have multiple) that makes you immediately know what manga you're talking about when you mention it. I generally include the tidbit that most reminds me of the manga if I like it but can't remember what it's about. This may contain spoilers for the manga, so readers beware. The exception to this is when a manga is so good that you just won't forget about it, or so lack-lustre there's nothing worth bringing up.

#### The Stereotypical Life of a Reincarnated Lady (Romcom) (5/10 (-2))

* **Synopsis**: Woman reincarnates as noble lady
* **Genre**: romcom, manhwa
* **Release rate:** Weekly
* **Read until**: Ch 36
* **Should you read it**: I wouldn't really recommend it. So why is this manhwa on this list? I don't know. I just couldn't stop reading it. It's not a *terrible* manhwa per se, but if you were to ask me what I liked about it, I wouldn't be able to give you an answer.

</TabItem>


<TabItem value="b">

#### Why are you doing this, duke? (shoujo) (8/10 (-2))
* **Synopsis**: Duke magically falls in love with woman he was about to kill
* **Genre**: shoujo, tragedy, comedy, manhwa
* **Release rate:** Weekly
* **Read until**: Ch 91 (main story finished)
* **Points**:
  * The story has some sweet shoujo moments and the expressions are well drawn.
  * However, the story is abysmal and that makes it very disappointing; even if I were to give the plot suspension of belief, it is just too nonsensical to enjoy it. I don't expect much from a shoujo, but come on. At least make the plot coherent.
  * **Major spoilers ahead, so don't read if you mind spoilers.** But in my opinion, if you're thinking about reading this, you should know what you're getting into. Don't go for a swim in the lake without knowing what kind of crocodile's swimming in it.
    * [SPOILER]: Why do I say the plot is nonsensical? Because when we are introduced to magic, we learn from the one who cast the spell that magic cannot have any power over the dead, and that when the magic medium dies, the spell is broken (here, I'm ignoring the fact that the stupid woman used her *all* of her remaining magic force to grant a child a wish, even though she obviously didn't have, nor should've have had, any intention to do so). This whole "What magic was cast on the MC and how do you complete it?" is a huge part of the story and is brought up time and again, so there is a lot of anticipation about it. Yet the purpose of the circle is not explained, its relation to the tarot cards are not explained, and there so many gaping plot points, like the fact that both characters die before it could be completed. By the story's own logic, the spell is broken when the spell's medium dies, and thus nothing good should happen; in fact, nothing at all should happen. Yet the spell is suddenly fully capable of sending the character back in time to when he was a youth, this time equipped with the full knowledge of what transpired in his previous life. There is zero explanation, zero foreshadowing, zero anything; it just happens. How? Why? There is no explanation. For all I know, this could just be a dream that the protagonist is having while he is bleeding out in the real world. And that is why I find it all so nonsensical and stupid. Had the author given this more thought, this manhwa could've been so much better. Instead, what we have is an ending that invalidates *the entire manhwa*, because this whole story literally revolves around learning more about the spell, completing it and fulfilling the wishes of its caster; in doing so, the duo would perhaps get a good ending of some sort. Unfortunately, the way this was handled is just utterly disappointing.
    * [SPOILER]: The bad ending leads me to think about the sequence of events that led to its occurrence, and that only magnified my dissatisfaction with the execution of the story. The level of security and protection accorded to the protagonists is unrealistically pathetic. Even though they are incredibly rich, rich enough to own their own castle and port, and also possesses sufficient political clout and military strength to make the crown prince perceive them as a threat to his right to the throne, the duchess' *entire* security detail can be killed by a single assassin, and their *entire* castle defences can be penetrated in less than an hour (as opposed to a siege which would last days or months). The level of political intrigue is likewise very lacking as well. The main character chooses to perform a rescue *on his lonesome*, without any strategizing, preparation or plans whatsoever. No money was invested on assassins, poisons, secret assassination techniques, political allies; nothing. He just charges in and dies with the main protagonist. I am aware that this is a shoujo manga so plot may not be its strong point, but the quality of storytelling is a little too lacking here. You could tell me that a magic circle suddenly appeared on their dead bodies and the two are reborn as witch and warlock, and that story would still make as much sense as the current story.
    * [SPOILER]: This story has a bad ending in both senses of the word; one is the cop-out ending of "I am suddenly young again with all knowledge, and thus I create my happy ending", and the second is that the protagonists die a miserable death with 0 ability to resist the bad guy (largely due to their own incompetence).

<TabItem value="h">

#### I'm a spider, so what? (Reincarnation action seinen) (6/10 (+0))
* **Synopsis**: Reincarnates as spider
* **Genre**: action, seinen
* **Release rate**: Monthly
* **Points**:
  * MC undergoes tremendous suffering and has plot armor. 
  * Similar to Slime Rimuru plot, but more gruesome and interaction with humans (and other intelligent beings) comes at a much later stage.
  * However, unlike Slime Rimuru, there is significantly less planning and strategizing. The quality of novel TLs is also significantly weaker. Think of it as comparing a hack-and-slash game to a RPG game.
  * Novel TL quality is, frankly speaking, pretty bad.
  * An unpolished gemstone. There is a lot of potential in this story and you can tell there was a lot of effort. Unfortunately, the way it is told is very lacklustre; there is not enough explanation when it is needed. For example, you'll encounter stuff like "MA" energy or something early on, but it's not explained at all, even though it will turn out to be an important plot point later on. All these unexplained stuff add up and as a result, what could've been a very interesting story will turn into a very *unsatisfying* and *difficult* read. This is exacerbated by how the author loves to tell the story from different perspectives, to the point where each chapter is told from the perspective of a new character; it can get confusing, especially when the translator doesn't tell you whose perspective it is now.
    * Sometimes only reveals the percept of a character after the character has reacted to it (e.g. author shows MC getting angry and then going to beat up someone, but doesn't tell u why she got angry, or even what she saw until after she beat up the person) 
    * The TL quality for the novel is pretty bad. 
    * I think the worst thing about this manga/novel is that after reading quite a bit and learning more about the world, the plot feels quite shallow and tbh I don't understand the motivation of some of the characters even after reading it (either due to bad TL quality or just plain poor storytelling by the author). 
    * Hopefully the manga improves upon what is already there, or else it will remain a dirty piece of rock.
    * It's hard to avoid drawing comparisons to Slime Rimuru. IMO, the plot progression is much faster than Rimuru, but the quality and depth of storytelling and the plot itself just far worse.
* **Should you read it:** Art quality is exceptional and combat is interesting. Unfortunately, the release rate is slow as hell for the manga, even though the story progression is faster than Slime Rimuru. Also, expect the story to change midway through. At the first part, it is very lacking in proper social interaction at the start of the manga (the author literally creates a skill so that MC can split her consciousness to talk to multiple mental copies of herself); for the entire manga so far you can count with one hand the number of (proper) conversations the MC has had with other creatures. In the second part, the quality of interactions remains quite meh. Honestly, what makes this series bad is not really the quality itself, but how the story could've been so much better if the plot was better fleshed out and the storytelling done better. My disappointment with the plot and storytelling is immeasurable, and I don't really recommend this. The quality of the action scenes are quite well done, but beyond that, it's pretty trash.

#### Secretly Cultivate For A Thousand Years (Cultivation manhwa) (8/10 (+0))

* **Synopsis**: Guy cultivates but is supported by a "system" and is stupidly overpowered
* **Genre**: cultivation, comedy, action
* **Release rate**: Weekly
* **Review written at**: chp175
* **Points:**
  * I read it when I was getting back into reading manhwa. It's not particularly amazing but it's a somewhat funny read.
  * The biggest reason why I picked it up was the art. I was really impressed at the level of detail! Or maybe I was just easily impressed lol. The art is actually kind of cool.
  * It makes some references to other cultivation manhwa like cultivation chat group.
  * It's the kind of manhwa where you know what is going to happen because the same pattern happens every time; guy cultivates at home, one-shots everything, gets rewards from some sort of system, gets some sort of progression and the cycle repeats. It's pretty predictable, but still something I enjoyed when I wanted to just read something that didn't need much brainpower.
  * Progression for some of the characters can feel a little neglected; expect some characters to drop out of the plot for large swaths of the story.
  * **Should you read it**: Eh... Sure why not lmao.
  * **Tidbit**: The facial expressions are hilarious... Why does the author like drawing the character with long nose lol

#### Shed! Ryugasaki-san (slice-of-life ecchi romcom) (7/10 (+0))

* **Synopsis**: Romance between weird boy and lizard girl
* **Genre**: slice-of-life, romcom, somewhat ecchi
* **Release rate**: Monthly / Irregular
* **Read until**: ch125
* **Points:**
  * I don't know why I read it. But once I started I just wanted to read it to the latest chapter lol.
  * Don't expect anything deep or mind-blowing or amazing; it's a 4-koma manga that doesn't have amazing art, doesn't have strong story arcs of any sort (side-characters come and go and are not too impactful). But still a reasonably entertaining read if you want something light. Or perhaps my standards have dropped, lol. 
  * Much of the humor comes from the fact that the characters are (designed to be) weird. Much of the sweetness comes from the fact that despite their weirdness, both parties accept each other. It's a somewhat common trope, but it's taken to a next level of weird because of the MC's... exotic preference for reptilians.
* **Should you read it**: Eh... Sure why not lmao. 
* **Tidbit**: If you see any references to weird reptilian kinks, this manga was probably an inspiration

#### Meng Shi Zai Shang (Xianxia manhwa) (7/10 (+0))

* **Synopsis**: female MC killed by "main character" ML and restarts her life as his master
* **Genre**: cultivation, manhwa
* **Release rate**: Weekly
* **Read until**: ch214
* **Points:**
  * Manhwa story supposedly different from that of the novel
  * The ML or FL can be said to be of true neutral alignment, leaning towards good. 
  * A lot of the characters aren't very nice though, so I wouldn't really say this is a wholesome manhwa. It's not a bad thing tbh
  * IMO a frustrating manhwa to read, and I don't like it:
    * 1. It's boring. The fights are short and end in an anti-climatic manner, and the art depicting the fight scenes are pretty meh. Xianxia is a great setting because you can bring in many interesting cultivation techniques and fantasy can become reality in the universe; it is exciting to see powerful cultivators bring their techniques to bear on each other, or perhaps we see some choreography or something. But none of this happens. The fights are boring and it really impacts the story. Of course, the story isn't all about fighting, but it plays a large role.
    * 2. The main characters are exhaustingly and frustratingly *stupid*. 
      * We have a FML who is powerful in cultivation levels, retains full knowledge and experiences of her past life (or lives), and has access to all sorts of treasures and rarities, yet she takes zero precautions whatsoever, leading to almost every other situation where her *disciple* (who is *levels* weaker than her) to rescue her. During which, she undergoes several unnecessary painful, near-death or disadvantageous situations due to her neglect to personal regard (I'm pretty sure she doesn't think she is immortal, and even if she is childish she should prioritize the avoidance of pain, so there isn't any other reason to explain this other than the fact that she is *exceptionally* stupid). I don't care if she's unlucky; she *knows* she is unlucky, yet she does nothing to account for that.
      * The ML, for some reason, has a 50,000 year old male spirit accompanying him in his secret realm (how he has either of these boons was never explained in the manhwa, or at least I don't remember), but this spirit, despite all his supposed wisdom, is exceedingly dense and stupid for his age, and his knowledge is suspect (he almost kills the MC at the start of the manhwa because of his stupidity for example).
    * 3. The plot is repetitive. We see the same shit again and again:
      * 1. ML will always reject power (techniques, masters, realms, connections whatever) if it interferes with his potential love life with his master, and he will always be jealous and possessive.
        * 1.5. Every other important male character will somehow admire FML, while every other important female character will somehow admire ML and envy FML
      * 2. FML will keep disguising as someone to follow ML, but ML will always see through it.
      * 3. The old geezer with the ML will never realize the disguised person is the FML (I told you this guy is an idiot)
      * 4. FML will *always* get into trouble and ultimately cause trouble for the ML, or for someone else, due to some negligence of her part (you expect me to believe a cultivator of her experience and power cannot deal with the petty bullshit in the story without getting injured as badly as she does? she is obviously not taking anything seriously, and it makes no sense for her *not* to take anything seriously either)
      * 5. FML is incredibly dense about the ML's love for her, and also incredibly dense about her feeling for him. The reason why she's so dense isn't explained even though it is shown that she loved the ML in her past life, and likely remembers that. These facts that are contradictory and when left unexplained, it is frustrating.
    * 4. As if it isn't frustrating enough, there's a lot of idiots dropping spoilers in the comments which likely have no relevance to the manhwa because, the story of the manhwa is not necessarily the same as the novel
  * It's probably a pretty big series in china or something for it to get a manhwa, and the plot revealed by the comments show that there's some depth to the story, but as it stands, it's just very tedious and boring.
* **Should you read it**: No. I think some people may like it? But imo, no, just no. If you really, absolutely must read it, try the novel instead.

#### When the villainess loves (8/10 (+0))

* **Synopsis**: Isekai into novel's villainess who is fatally ill 
* **Genre**: reverse harem, shoujo, bishounen
* **Release rate**: Weekly
* **Read until**: ch34
* **Points:**
  * Story follows the cliche "I isekai'ed into this world based on a novel I read, I know their backstories, I want to stop them from loving the novel's protagonist to prevent their deaths, but through my intervention they ended up loving me instead"
  * MC simps for all the male leads. The translators are on an even crazier level than the MC with their TL notes.
    * The manga has such a dedicated fanbase. But it's still trashy as hell though.
    * The commentary by the translators make this manga x100 funnier than it should be.
  * The art style is exquisite and the introduction to the story is not half bad, but the story slowly devolves into reverse harem and non-stop simping. But the art is really good. 
  * At the end of the day, it's trash written specifically for girls/women who like to simp for 2D men; which is kind of funny, because the art quality is exceptional, and the storytelling isn't uninteresting either (it's not easy to make such a cliche type of story entertaining).
* **Should you read it**: I can't advise on that because this isn't my type of manga. It's still too early for any big plot reveals to be made.

#### Sincerely: I became a duke's maid (Isekai josei) (7/10 (+0))

* **Synopsis**: Woman pities MC, isekais into his world as a maid to save him, and unwittingly changes the story
* **Genre**: romance, slice-of-life, shoujo/josei, isekai, harem(ish)
* **Release rate**: Weekly
* **Should you read**: I have mixed feelings about this one; it's both good and bad.
  * The manga drops the ball when it comes to handling big, important plot points. Main lead makes an unexplained isekai arrival into the novel after falling asleep (which makes a cliche introduction even more lame), then rescues the prince from the curse with an unexplained prayer which scars her hand for some unexplained reason (which makes an important plot moment cringe, cheesy and lame all at the same time). While they can be salvaged in the future (e.g. by explaining that she died before isekai-ing, and that she resolved the curse due to her lineage or something), the way they were handled are very... cliche, anti-climatic, unsatisfying.
  * Some may find the shota to bishounen transformation weird. I found it somewhat unsettling myself.
  * Timeskips are not clearly highlighted with narration and it is only told through speech bubbles. It is easy for the reader to read portions of the story with the same frame of mind, despite the fact that a season has passed or 3 years have passed etc.
  * I can't help but get the vibe that the main FL is meant to be a self-insert.
  * Yet, the characters are relatively well fleshed out; their actions are consistent with their personalities & beliefs, which are in turn consistent with their backgrounds and initial perceptions. They give me the vibe that I wouldn't find it boring if I were to perform character analysis on them, yet to some extent I think I'm just overthinking it.
    * The MC's mental age clearly affects the way he acts
    * Main female lead can't stop thinking about what happens in the novel as opposed to what is actually happening

#### Slime Life (7/10 (+0))

* **Synopsis**: Black mage gets slime assistant because he is cute
* **Genre**: comedy, slice-of-life, shoujo?
* **Release rate**: Weekly
* **Read until**: 150
* **Should you read it**: The story is not very deep and it has a very fairy tale, shoujo-ish kinda vibe. I just kept reading it because the slime is cute lol, and it does have its touching moments. This manga is an entertaining read. If they just want something cute to munch on, then this is right up their alley.

#### Tomo-chan wa Onnanoko (romcom) (10/10 (+0))

* **Synopsis**: A love story between a tomboy and a guy who are both ridiculously athletic
* **Genre**: romcom
* **Release rate**: Completed
* **Chapters**: 956, but most of them are just 1 page. Effectively ~60-65 chapters
* **+ve points**:
    * There's a lot more "show but don't tell" moments than other manga, partially because of it's structure
    * There are some really (rare) funny parts 471 472 505 793 801 832 868
* **-ve points**:
    * Clicking through the pages can be a pain
* **Should you read it**: Hm. Thinking back to this manga now I don't really have any outstanding memories of it. Don't get me wrong, it's got sweet and funny moments and it was kinda refreshing to read with its 1 page structure, but it's not terribly memorable. 
* **Tidbit**: This manga doesn't have a tidbit because I honestly don't remember any outstanding moments (aside from the confessions and the part where someone got angry)

#### 5-Toubun (8/10 (+0))

* **Synopsis**: Poor guy falls in love with the quintuplets he tutors
* **Genre**: romcom, school life
* **Release rate**: Completed
* **Points**: 
  * This is a trashy romcom:
    * I call this a "romcom", but in truth there isn't a lot of comedy
    * Get ready for a lot of cliche plot devices utilized in Niseikoi, Bokuben etc. Author loves to play one cliche after another. He'll play the "MC will marry one of them" card by doing a flashforward of MC getting married to one of the five, he'll play the childhood friend card, he'll play the "they will stay together if they do this in the festival" with the "everyone participated so it doesn't matter", he'll play the "we originally didn't want him but now we do" card, he'll play the "MC is suddenly in his popular phase" card, the cliche too-shy-to-fess-up FL, cliche I-love-him-too-but-lemme-bottle-it-up-for-others FL, inevitable love struggles between FLs etc etc etc.
    * Get ready for MC-has-to-choose-one (as opposed to bokuben's solution to this problem).
    * Get ready to be annoyed by everyone in the story in some way or another at the start, because they were designed to be annoying
  * The concept of quintuplets is one of the manga's most unique points which the mangaka will use again and again to play with some "whodunnit" and "who is that" situations.
  * There isn't really a moment of peace in this manga (or at least, not that I can recall). The characters are almost always either under stress due to their studies, or stress from work, or stress from dramatic relationships. If that's not the case, then the chapter is busy dropping big plot bombs. Don't expect a chapter where the characters just sit down for a cup of tea and the chapter passes by peacefully. This is good when the series is still running and readers have to wait a week for the next chapter, but in terms of progression for people who are reading chapter after chapter, I feel it's a bit too tense and too rushed, especially for this type of genre.
  * All points said, there are still plot twists to keep things interesting (but they don't subvert the cliches I raised above)
    * This can make the manga worth reading a second time.
* **Is it worth reading**: Uhhhhm. I found the manga a little too cliche for my tastes, but the manga did get better in the later half.

#### That Girl is not just cute (romcom) (9.5/10 (+0))

* **Synopsis**: A love story between a really unlucky boy and a strong girl who protects him.
* **Genre**: slice-of-life, romcom (cute, sweet, focus on friendships & romance)
* **Release rate**: Weekly
* **Read until**: Ch 85
* **+ve points**:
    * A lot of sweet and cute moments
    * For this type of genre, the consistent weekly update and quality is definitely a plus
    * The art is pretty high quality tbh, author loves to draw the female protag in various outfits. It's almost like a fashion show
* **Should you read it**: I would recommend it to people who like sweet manga and that slice-of-life BGR. However, there's not much beyond that, so it stays in the +0 bonus score range. It's one of the few manga that I consistently follow though.
* **Tidbit**: Hachimatsu (  ´‿`)

#### The Pharmarcy Where the Wolf Howls (Josei romcom) (9/10 (+0?))

* **Synopsis**: Pharmacist meets shunned celebrity from her childhood
* **Genre**: romcom, josei, manhwa

* **Read until**: 35
* **Should you read it**: There's quite a lot of drama in this manhwa (although it's not between the main ship), so if you're not into that sort of thing I wouldn't recommend this. There are some funny parts, but unfortunately I don't find it very memorable (largely because the manhwa is still in its early stages).

#### Bakarina (Harem Comedy) (8/10 (+0))

* **Synopsis**: "My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!" That's right, the name of the manga is the synopsis
* **Genre**: comedy, harem
* **Release rate**: Irregular
* **Read until**: 31
* **Points**:
    * Very dense MC
    * Everyone noteworthy will fall hopelessly in love with the MC and devote their lives to her. This could get dry real quick
    * The release rate for the manga sucks and it isn't as good as the anime. The anime adaptation was quite well done.
* **Should you read it**: It's a moderate manga; the anime brings the plot out better than the manga. The main appeal of this manga is that it loves to pull off ironic situations. The harem thing gets stale quite easily though and the characters are currently kinda skin-deep in general. There's some tension when characters get into potentially dangerous situations, but with this kind of manga you don't have to worry too much.
* **Tidbit**: Did you know the pet name for this manga is Bakarina? It is quite easy to guess why..

#### Beware of the Villainess! (Shoujo isekai romcom) (9/10 (+1))

* **Synopsis**: Protagonist reincarnates as villainess in a shoujo novel and protects original MC from her love interests
* **Genre**: webtoon, shoujo, isekai, romcom, reverse harem?, comedy
* **Release rate**: Irregular (3 times a month)
* **Read until**: 55
* **Should you read it**: The plot is honestly not very deep, but it is a somewhat entertaining read with some interesting personalities. 
  * The highlight of this manga is the facial expressions and the relationship between the MC and her maid.
  * Expect shoujo level of romance; which is to say, not a lot of romance is involved; the focus is more on the comedic facial expressions in my opinion. 
  * Expect the usual "ah, I have this special advantage because I read this part in the novel."
  * Most of the story follows the MC's expectations of the novel for the time being. While there are some interesting plot points, the story hasn't developed them yet. As it stands, the manga is sufficiently promising to follow, and also has a sizeable fanbase.
  * [SPOILER]: Also expect abit of yuri.

#### Wotakoi (Josei slice-of-life romcom) (9/10 (+1))

* **Synopsis**: otakus
* **Genre**: slice-of-life, romcom (focus on romance)
* **Setting**: salarymen / women, working life
* **Release rate**: Monthly
* **Read until**: Ch 63
* **Points**: 
    * Plot is all about the 6 main characters (4 + 2 who will be introduced later)
    * Mostly on sweet / romance moments rather than "HAHAHA" funny (although there are some funny moments)
    * Some chapters (esp. the earlier ones) make a lot of references to popular otaku culture
      * These are usually explained in TL notes
      * That said, if you are someone who enjoys that type of material, you'll likely enjoy these kinds of references
    * Limited drama and tribulations, if you're into that sort of thing
    * Abit cliche; all (initial) main characters are of different blood type groups 
    * Author loves to interact with his readers, so there's even some chapters where he draws fan-submitted situations of the characters. Although, at that point, the manga gives off doujin vibes rather than an actual manga...
* **-ve points**:
  * Sometimes uses lazy character development; telling instead of showing. e.g. manga becomes a slideshow of how each character would do something e.g. peel tangerines in Ch24 as opposed to *revealing* that fact through storytelling by putting them in a scenario that brings out how they would peel tangerines (e.g. characters come together for a party, and they react to Hirotaka peeling tangerines). 
  * Sometimes splits the story into multiple unstated timelines (e.g. Ch 53 and 53.5) where the chronological order is uncertain. This is makes the manga's chronology very messy. The weaker timeline ends up feeling like a spin-off, and the sum of the two parts is weaker than what it would've been if it were presented in chronological order as a whole. This is a design decision, and in my opinion a poor one. It makes sense if the events are happening concurrently (e.g. Yakuza 0, the chapters of Kiryu's & Majima's stories are presented in alternating order), but in this case the second timeline can be written off as a timeless slice-of-life with a different vibe and pacing; jumping between these timelines just weakens the impact of the main timeline.
  * The otaku aspect gets a little stale after awhile. I'd prefer to see more facets of the characters (e.g. reactions to unexplored content for example). 
  * Yeah as you might guess the plot isn't super deep but it does have some flitting food for thought moments
* **Should you read it**: If you like stories that give you diabetes and you enjoy reading about otakus hanging out. For all its shortcomings, I personally found this a pretty good read, and the initial part of the manga is a pretty good hook.
* **Tidbit**: Flat-chested Narumi

#### Horimiya (Slice-of-life romcom) (9/10 (+1))

* **Synopsis**: A wholesome slice-of-life story with a loner and a popular girl and their friends
* **Genre**: slice-of-life / romcom (mostly slice of life with some sweet romantic moments)
* **Setting**: high-school / family
* **Release rate**: Monthly (irregular)
* **Read until**: Can't remember
* **Special Note**: I come back to this manga every few years to catch up
* **+ve points**:
    * although it's called horimiya, everyone is involved in the slice-of-life manga (although main couple gets the spotlight)
* **Points**:
    * I call this slice-of-life because there are a lot of filler chapters, limited plot progression (yes you *literally* wait irl years for the plot, if any, to progress), but the characters and relationships are fleshed out.
    * Horimiya actually involves their relationship with their family (in particular the Hori family) which can be kinda refreshing for a romcom
* **-ve points:**
    * some of the characters look too similar at the start so it's easy to mix up iura-kun
* **Should you read it**: Hmmm. I'd say yes if you want a manga to read and kinda just chill. It's got that calming / soothing vibe to it since a lot of the scenes are at the Hori household. I don't recommend getting too attached because of how slow it is.
* **Disclaimer**: That said, the story progresses very slowly (if ever) after ~ chapter 37 or so, hence I call it slice-of-life because you've probably retired by the time they graduate
* **Tidbit**: [SPOILER] Hori likes being submissive uh...

#### Chitra (Isekai Reverse Harem) (9/10, (+1))

* **Synopsis**: Woman reborn in fantasy world and plays irl Civilization
* **Genre**: manhwa, isekai, reverse harem, josei
* **Release rate**: Irregular
* **Read until**: Ch63
* **Points**:
  * Reverse harem is strong in this manhwa
  * Sometimes feels like The Gamer with all the game pop-ups and gachapon
  * Some parts of the manga feels kinda cringe, although I can't put my finger on the reason.
  * There is a lot of world building, so if you're into the idea of a woman isekai-ing into a fantasy world and building her own nation/dynasty + harem, you'll really like this
* **Should you read it**: Chitra's a weird bag of chocolates. It's got cringe moments, it's got reverse harem moments, it's got **a lot** of gachapon moments, it's got nation building moments, it's got some sweet moments, funny moments, action moments etc. It's honestly not bad if you're willing to look past some of the rough edges.

#### Volcanic Age (Wuxia) (Score: 9/10, (+1))

* **Warning**: This manga triggered some readers due to its portrayal of Tibetan Buddhism. Personally I don't really mind since it's supposed to be fictional.
* **Synopsis**: MC experiences the same life again but with all of his knowledge
* **Genre**: Wuxia, manhwa
* **Release rate**: Weekly
* **Read until**: 72
* **Points**:
  * So far, this follows a classic "MC is so stupidly OP" plotline. Not surprising given the premise of MC being reborn with all his knowledge.
  * Some parts aren't very well translated (or the manhwa isn't very clear on what's actually happening / being conveyed, or the translators keep changing the names). This hinders the quality of the manhwa because you have to do guesswork on what is actually being said and what is actually happening.
  * Reader should have some prior knowledge about cultivation concepts (otherwise you might get a little lost about how he's powering up; that point is hardly elaborated on).
  * Characters, sects and names in general are poorly introduced (or at least, not memorably so). Sometimes you don't know who/what they are referring to.
  * Sometimes characters just disappear altogether from the location without any explanation on where they went.
  * Art isn't too bad; fight scenes are pretty solid.
* **Should you read it**: Hmm. It's a fun read if you don't mind the fact that the MC knows everything that happened in the future, and thus also knows all the secrets (and takes them for himself to become stupidly powerful). MC outclasses his enemies so much that you can count the number of times he gets injured with one hand and he's only lost once to a super OP elder. It's for this reason I stopped following the manhwa even though it's barely near the end of the story, simply because I know how everything will pan out even without reading it (i.e. MC wins everytime *unscratched*); it just gets boring after a while.

#### Welcome to Dungeon Hotel (slice-of-life action?) (9/10 (+2))
* **Genre**: comedy, romance, action

So while "normal" heroes (called "hunters") have like the usual RPG-esque progression (warrior, mage, etc whatever), the protagonist upgrades her hotel as she levels up etc. which I found super interesting.

#### Survive as the hero's wife (novel isekai) (9/10 (+2))
* **Genre**: romance, political intrigue
* **Summary**: *Another* korean "I isekai'ed into this novel" story. IMO it's one of the better ones
* **Points:**
  * Exceptional art and storytelling, especially for its type
  * s2manga's shitty translation destroys part of the manga
  * Some characters just get forgotten entirely (e.g. ML's master)
  * Feels like a mix between shoujo and josei, but also some seinen
* **Should you read it:** If you had to choose only 1 of these isekai novel stories, you wouldn't go wrong with choosing this one. It's probably one of the best, if not the best of its kind; for one, the plot isn't as predictable as the rest which makes it kinda interesting, there are bumps in the relationship between the FL and ML which makes it less cliche, the storytelling is deeper and there is more exposition where it matters that set this apart from its competitors.

* **Setting**: high school
* **Release rate**: Completed

    * Some parts can be a bit too random / weird
    * May have to trudge through the first few chapters
    * Some parts can be a bit too idealistic
    * There's quite a lot of filler
    * [SPOILER] MC gets a harem forced on him (arbitrary reasons as to why so many like him... seriously, *why*?)
    * The way tension is defused in the manga can get abit repetitive over time
    * Some side characters don't really get fleshed out, can feel a little shallow at times
    * [SPOILER] Shirou literally gets zero character development which is honestly such a waste of potential
    * Has a tendency to flesh out a character in 1 arc, then just toss them aside for the rest of the story; kinda lazy for the author to do that if you ask me
* **Should you read it:** Some parts feel a little draggy, but in general worth reading; truly a rollercoaster of emotions. I didn't really appreciate this manga while I was reading it, but thinking back, I think it was quite funny in general.
* **Will I re-read it:** Probably not, there's too many fillers, but some parts are legit hilarous
* **Tidbit**: ( ⚆ _ ⚆ ) ( ⚆ _ ⚆ ) when they find out what sucking blood really means to vampires

#### Bokuben (9/10 +2)
* Ongoing (soon to be completed)
* **Summary**: Trashy romcom
* **Worth reading**: A lot of filler / fanservice throughout the story. An enjoyable read, but like I said it's a pretty trashy romcom; a guilty pleasure. Some characters don't get enough justice.

#### Leveling Up by only Eating (9/10 (+2))
* **Synopsis**: MC who can't stop eating plays a realistic VR MMORPG so that he won't get fatter
* **Genre**: manhwa, shounen, slice-of-life, VR, food
* **Release rate**: Unknown (new manhwa). So far quite inconsistent; may have been dropped
* **Read until**: 49
* **Points**:
  * If you're someone who used to play MMORPGs you might find this manhwa rather nostalgic. I reminisced about my time playing Runescape while reading this manhwa.
  * This manhwa *really* focuses on food, so you might get hungry while reading. HAHA
  * The game world really revolves around our MC; there's literally a secret class specially for people who love to eat in the game, and he is a magnet for (non-romantic) NPC affection who are tired of players who just want to rank up.
* **Should you read it**: Personally, I found it enjoyable and at times funny to read. It's action packed, but also no stress because it's all a VR and you know the MC will pull through (even though he cares more about eating than anything else) It's quite lighthearted.

#### The Undefeatable Swordsman (Action) (Score: 9/10, (+2?))
* **Synopsis**: MC is very badass
* **Genre**: manhwa, shounen
* **Setting**: Feudal times, Korea, martial arts, Taoism 
* **Release rate**: Irregular
* **Read until**: Ch38
* **Points**:
  * The story still feels kinda young, it's only completed like maybe 1-2 story arcs
  * SPOILER-ISH: MC becomes pretty damn OP pretty quick, like maybe even abit too quick tbh
    * SPOILER-ISH: I'm honestly expecting the MC to fall to the dark side somewhere down the road because of how fast he is going
* **Should you read it**: It's still too early to draw conclusions on the quality of this manhwa as it's only at around 38 chapters. So far, so good.

#### Sijin (Drama Tragedy) (Score: 9/10, (+2))
* **Synopsis**: Woman relives her life with all her knowledge

* **Points**:
  * [BIG SPOILERS FROM FINISHED NOVEL]: 49f0bad299687c62334182178bfd75d8 7f021a1415b86f2d013b2618fb31ae53. Still, it's not too bad because the story is implied to 0663b8af9df17b966dc2116a2a4ce571 with less 21c3a46e069cdaac3ea89bd54449edaf.
    * Use MD5 decryptor to see the spoilers.
* **Should you read it**: The story is less like manga / manhwa and more like chinese drama with all the tragedy, scheming and plotting. It's a read I found hard to put down, and is quite entertaining. The big spoilers above is kinda a put off, but I still can't help but continue reading it.

#### We May Be An Inexperienced Couple But... (Seinen romcom) (Score: 9/10, (+2))
* **Warning**: M18+ content
* **Synopsis**: Married life with a lot of emphasis on doing the putting it in and taking it out at the start
* **Genre**: romcom, seinen, slice-of-life
* **Release rate**: Weekly
* **Read until**: 59
* **Should you read it**: Some parts are borderline hentai (even when censored), so if you're not into that sort of thing I don't recommend this at all. If you're okay with that sort of thing, it's a pretty sweet romance manga with decent story progression and sometimes talks about adult life stuff (that isn't necessarily M18). Not a lot of drama, and a lot of that sexual tension eventually weans off and the story starts going into married slice-of-life.

#### My Wife Is A Demon Queen (Shounen) (10/10 (+3))
* **Synopsis**: An isekai story where protagonist is summoned into a fantasy world
* **Genre**: manhwa, shounen, isekai, romance (abit)
* **Release Rate:** original manhwa releases twice a week (yes, chinese manhwa artists are madmen)
* **Points**:
  * Fantasy world (think renaissance era) with magic, (simple) martial arts, swordfighting and archery as the main combat techniques
  * Interesting mechanic of forging, the protagonist will make this manga interesting by bringing in modern technology into this fantasy world
  * Don't expect a lot of romance (at least, action would dominate the manga).
  * Some fanservice.
  * There is the occasional plot armor.
  * Makes references and pays tribute to other popular series (some concepts will be similar as well)
  * Spoilers alert:
    * Protagonist will become very OP, but in an unconventional manner. 
    * Demon queen is tsundere
* **Should you read it:** Yes! It is a very entertaining read. The quality of this chinese manhwa is really good, even though the plot starts off a little shallow. If you're looking for a shounen manga to sink your teeth into, this is a good one. Unfortunately some of the chapters are very short with very little actual plot progression.

<TabItem value="g">

#### The Duchess' 50 Tea Recipes (10/10 (+3))
* **Synopsis**: An isekai story about nobility, tea, business (a little) and love
* **Genre**: manhwa, josei, romance, isekai (british nobility)
* **Read until**: Ch100
* **Points**:
  * Not gonna lie, the start's quite different from the general vibe of the manhwa with all the in-fighting and doubting of MC. Similar types of drama will continue to occur every now and then in the series, but just not at same the frequency and intensity at the start.
  * This manhwa is easily one of the sweetest manga/manhwa I've ever read. The manga really focuses on tea; the vivid description of the characters brewing tea and drinking it makes me feel as if I can smell and taste the tea, giving the manhwa a very sweet and soothing vibe (literally, since I can't help but imagine tasting the tea and smelling the tea leaves). This literal sweetness complements the sweetness of the numerous wholesome / romance scenes in the manhwa, and the end result is something that ridiculously sweet.
  * Of course, as an isekai manga, expect the MC to use her past life to great advantage in her current life
  * Interesting trivia knowledge on tea and a little bit on business and history. Honestly makes me want to drink tea myself...
    * MC is so knowledgeable about tea it almost breaks secondary belief tbh. But I can overlook that
  * Okay, some readers in the manga's comments didn't really like the (obsessive) focus on tea. Personally I thought it was fine (although I prefer tea over coffee myself, so that is my bias)
* **Should you read it:** I can't emphasize how sweet this manhwa is, so read it if you're into wholesome stuff. The first 10 or so chapters may be a pill to swallow if you're only here for wholesome content (and it's a theme that will come up every now and then), but in general, quite wholesome and sweet. The only thing keeping me from calling it a safe recommendation is due to the (excessive) amount of PDA and/or tea appreciation in the manhwa (to the point that tea literally make or break national relations) which may make it a turn-off for some readers (it doesn't break secondary belief imo though, because it is still quite well-written). Don't expect explicit scenes, but expect a lot of kissing and implied xxx, so it's a little nsfw.

<TabItem value="f">

#### Love Advice from the Great Duke of Hell (10/10 (+3))
* **Synopsis**: Boy summons great duke of hell for love advice
* **Genre**: comic, comedy, action, romance(?)
* **Release rate**: Irregular, still ongoing. Split into seasons. Release rate when a season is active is once every Friday.
* **Points**:
  * The facial expressions are on point.
  * There's a few spoilers on the structure of the manga after this point, so read at your own discretion. If you just want a yes/no recommendation, I'd say the comic is very well written, but if you're turned off by the slapstick comedy and *very* awkward moments at the first half of the comic (which *will* make you experience second-hand embarrassment), you may find it a long wait for you to enjoy the comic to it's fullest.
  * This comic is very interestingly written (and arguably very well written), but the structure is pretty wack.
    * The first season of the comic deploys slapstick comedy that is absolutely hilarious, but makes you go "wtf" at the same time.
    * The second season of the comic (which is maybe around chapter 70 onwards) is when the author starts making huge plot advancements, revealing plot twists, where all the action comes in and where the comedy starts to taper down. This is also the part where you start to go "holy crap", because you expected it to be a silly comic with all that's happened in the first season, but the author is dropping big brain plot twists all over the place and you start seeing how the characters are related in ways you didn't think of.
    * The third season hasn't started yet.
    * There isn't that much romance so far, and I've read like 100+ chapters already. There's obviously some love involved, but calling it a **romance** comic is a bit of a stretch.

#### Oresama Teacher (Shoujo Romcom) (Score: 9/10 (+3))
* **Synopsis**: Delinquent girl turns a new leaf (?) when she changes school 
* **Genre**: shoujo, romcom (focus on comedy)
* **Release rate**: Irregular
* **Read until**: 155
* **Fav chapter**: probably 72 lol really made me burst out loud
* **+ve points:**
    * the facial expressions are on point and the humor is quite good
* **Points**:
    * [SPOILER-ISH] I didn't expect her to slowly form a reverse harem lol.. Then again, this is a shoujo
    * Don't expect in-depth romance. Any romance is usually touch & go, unrequited or just really close friendships kinda thing.
* **Should you read it:** I'd recommend it. It consistently delivers on the humor. The plot sometimes feels kinda shallow (e.g. everyone turns out to be a good guy in the end kinda vibes), and sometimes it's not too hard to guess the plot, but honestly it's pretty good.
* **Tidbit**: Usa-chan Man!

#### Kimetsu No Yaiba (9.5/10 +3)
* Completed
* **Summary**: Humans using swords and mystical breathing techniques to kill demons. 
* **Worth reading**: Nice series, but repetitive progression (fight big bad, defeat big bad, find out that big bad had tragic past that turned him into a demon, repeat. Maybe kill off a main character or two while you're at it).
  * Fight scenes are generally nice to read and watch.
  * Anime adaptation is really good. Like, **really** good.
  * Final fight scenes don't have enough people in the battle; feels like a 1v1 as opposed to army of demon slayers vs army of demons.
  * Ending feels rushed and it is very disappointing imo. Feels like a plot cop out. It doesn't make the *entire* manga bad, but it just gives it a bad aftertaste.

#### Kitsune Spirit (Shounen romcom) (Score: 10/10, (+3))
* **Synopsis**: A married couple in a world with supernatural creatures
* **Genre**: romcom (equal parts sweet and funny), shounen (yes, shounen. You'll see why. This can get dark real quick)
* **Release rate:** Irregular (and very short chapters). Updates might've stopped
* **Read until:** 101
* **Points**:
  * Some lewd moments
  * Like I said this can get dark quick
  * The chapters are a little short for a weekly
  * Starts off as romcom and then becomes shounen before going back to being a romcom again
* **Should you read it:** Not gonna lie, the characters, setting and story is kinda refreshing.
  * However, you'll be disappointed with its frequency of updates; which is to say, very slow update rate, and very short chapters... aaagh
* **Tidbit**: No citeable tidbit... but this pair is so cute~~~! e.g. Ch 99

#### Mission: Yozakura Family (Shounen romcom) (Score: 10/10, (+3))
* **Synopsis**: You'll know after reading the first chapter haha (yes, it's a bit spoilerish to explain this)
* **Genre**: romcom, shounen
* **Release rate**: Irregular
* **Read until**: 58
* **Points**:
  * It follows your usual shounen manga storyline: MC meets new big bad, powers up, meets another new big bad and gets stronger etc. It's not boring, but just expect that sort of story.
  * The story's a little too skewed towards the success of the protagonists.
  * Gives me Hero Academia vibes.
  * Also gives me some Demon Slayer vibes. Death is a common topic in this manga.
* **Should you read it:** Yes. It's quite well-written. I like how the story progresses. Sure, sometimes when you read a chapter you get the "Oh, this chapter is going to be about elaborating about this guy's personality" and such but I think overall it's well put together.

#### Do Chokkyuu Kareshi x Kanojo (Ecchi romcom) (9.5/10 (+4))
* **Synopsis**: Ridiculously straightforward & energetic boy finds love with somewhat straightforward girl
* **Genre**: romcom, mature, ecchi
* **Release rate**: Monthly
* **Read until**: Ch 34
* **Points**: 
  * Expect the comic to make some side-characters obsolete as the story progresses; they will fade so far into the background you wonder where they went.
  * Very funny romcom, and generally good plot progression.
  * If the genre tag isn't clear enough, let me re-emphasize this point: this manga is quite mature and touches upon sex quite often. Being that sort of manga, it also covers some ground that other more conventional romcoms don't touch upon (since the subject of sex is usually off limits). That said, it's largely dominated by the comedic aspects of the manga, so don't expect really deep discussion on that subject matter. 
  * It is very wholesome.
  * **Should you read it:**: Recommended if you are of age. It's a silly manga and the characters are unorthodox for a romcom, but they are endearing.

#### Nan Hao & Shang Feng (Comedy) (10/10 (+4))
* **Synopsis**: Slice-of-life high school manhwa that is stupidly hilarious
* **Genre**: Comedy
* **Release rate**: Inconsistent
* **Read until**: Ch 57
* **Should you read it:**: There is no plot; don't expect progression, or development etc. It's all slice-of-life. But what cements its spot as one of the top works of culture is how stupidly over-the-top funny it is. The art is exceptional, the facial expressions are all meme worthy and the comedy is consistently on point; the last time I laughed this hard at a comic was with Grand Blue. It makes a lot of references to other popular series, which is also pretty funny.

#### Peerless Dad (Action) (Score: 10/10 (+4))
* **Synopsis**: A father and his children
* **Genre**: Action, martial arts (wuxia), slice-of-life, manhwa
* **Release rate**: Irregular
* **Read until**: 151
* **Points**: 
  * Some of the characters (and the story in general) is really quite well-written.
  * It's a pretty fresh story with a family-oriented MC. This is a MC who prefers to do guard duty because he wants to spend more time with his kids.
  * MC also has quite a few secrets to unveil about his past and his master.
  * I love the character interactions.
  * The story can get dark. Tragedy is a common theme.
* **-ve points**:
  * [SPOILER]: A lot of references to another manga (red storm?) which I don't know anything about. 
* **Should you read it**: Well worth the read. It's a shame I read it so fast, because now I have to wait... Urrrgghh

#### Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet (Romcom) (Score: 10/10 (+4))
* **Synopsis**: A love story between two people from opposing countries in the same school.
* **Genre**: romcom (cute, sweet, funny, focus on friendships, love, discrimination and perserverance)
* **Setting**: high school
* **Release rate**: Completed
* **Chapters**: 119
* **+ve points:**
    * Very good pacing and progression of the story, length feels just right
    * Many funny, cute and sweet moments
    * (Most) characters are fleshed out and have depth
    * While it is still idealistic (what do you expect from a romcom), it's much more grounded most than other romcoms
    * Pretty good closure: Doesn't just end at the school level, but story also resolves conflict at a country-level and progresses all the way to marriage
* **Points**
    * A lot of fanservice
    * Content Warning: 1st chapter has abit of a rape-ish situation (this is the only time this happens throughout the manga so can relax)
* **-ve points:**
    * Some characters just there for the comic relief after their character arc (if they get one), wasted potential
    * Some characters have unfulfilling/silly endings
* **Should you read it**: Very highly recommended. It is very satisfying to read from start to finish and I still get goosebumps thinking about it. Again, exceptional pacing of the manga. Absolutely outstanding work.
* **Will I re-read it**: Maybe
* **Tidbit**: Honestly the highlight is that fact that the two main characters keep having to pretend to be something they aren't makes this such an entertaining read

<TabItem value="d">

#### Cheating Men Must Die (Simulated vengeance) (10/10 (+5))
* **Synopsis**: Woman from alternate reality isekais into various universes to take revenge against cheating men
* **Genre**: plotting/scheming, vengeance/justice, isekai, manhwa
* **Read until**: Ch 37
* **Points**: 
  * The manhwa is basically a series of short stories, where in each story the protagonist will isekai herself into the shoes of the woman who was cheated/wronged to enact sophisticated revenge on their target.
  * It's quite interesting because the revenge schemes are not straightforward "let's kill the target", but rather a literal deconstruction of the person's life to the point where the target ends up dying *after* watching their life crumble.
  * The whole manhwa is literally about scheming, plotting, backstabbing etc so I don't have to tell you this is not wholesome. The premise of each story is obviously 100% not wholesome because before the protagonist isekais into each "mini universe", we'd watch the backstory of the person she is isekai-ing into, and it's usually a pretty tragic backstory that emphasizes the horrendous wrongdoings of the person the protagonist is tasked to ruin.
  * The level of the revenge schemes are sometimes a little shallow because the protagonist has special abilities to make some things go her way (e.g. she can magically delete text messages for another person). This means that some of  the revenge schemes used in the plot are technically impossible to perform. There's some weak points in the plot, but overall quite well executed from what I read.
* **Should you read**: This is without a doubt, a masterpiece. Even though I have a strong preference for wholesome stuff, I admit it is still absolute gold. Give it a read if you love these kind of stories where the protagonist plots and schemes to get vigilante justice.

#### Mage Demon Queen (romcom) (Score: 10/10 (+5))
* **Synopsis**: Student adventurer falls in love with demon queen
* **Genre**: webtoon, romcom, yuri, seinen, ecchi
* **Release rate:** Weekly
* **Read until**: end of season 2
* **Points:**
  * If you're really averse to gay stuff, then stay away from this comic, because the main ship is yuri lol
  * But honestly I think it's as good as any other heterosexual romcom; the fact that this is yuri really didn't make that much of a difference in this comic imo.
  * The demons are often scantily clad and it's kinda ecchi.
  * But omg the pair is so cute!!!
  * As with some webtoon comics, it comes in "seasons". The first season appears to be a "let's try this idea and see how it turns out". The comics are shorter and the plot is less fleshed out, although it's still solid content. The plot starts kicking in halfway through season 1, although you do get the vibe that it's because the author decided to really sit down and flesh it out.
  * The art is pretty good though
  * The story subverts a lot of cliche concepts that are commonly found in this type of fantasy comics, and I really like that. The storytelling is exceptional and the characters are memorable.
  * A lot of references to popular culture is made, and I think there's a good balance of romance, comedy and action.
  * Generally quite funny! 
  * A few tragic moments/backstories but generally very wholesome
  * I'm pretty sure I saw some Singlish in this webtoon??? Author probably Singaporean / Malaysian? That's pretty rad.

#### Cultivation Chat Group (Xianxia Comedy) (Score: 9.5/10 (+5))
* **Synopsis**: Cultivation and martial arts in a modern world
* **Genre**: Xianxia, shounen, comedy
* **Release rate:** Weekly? (or maybe even every 3 days for the manhwa???)
* **Read until**: Ch 1700 (webnovel)
* **Points**:
  * The manhwa often falls short in quality (hence the 9.5 score), and some of the manhwa chapters are kinda meh compared to the novel. While it does make some scenes more funny, it understandably has to drop some of the finer details found in the webnovel, which kind of limits its potential as it doesn't bring out the full depth of the story.
  * Definitely a very entertaining read and the story is kinda well-thought out, even though MC will often pull out heaven-defying plot devices and get heaven-defying benefits because of his insanely powerful connections.
  * One of the interest aspects of this series is to bring a refreshing twist to xianxia by injecting modern elements into it. So you have these amazing battles with qi, blades and magical treasures, but these cultivators also use technology like handphones and such (hence the name). That being said, the use of handguns and rifles (in the conventional sense) is rather limited.
  * Being a Chinese story, there are some very Chinese concepts (e.g. the concept of "face") and a couple of terms directly translated from Chinese e.g. (seek death / 找死)
  * MC has plot armor / plot everything (to the point where it almost becomes a joke) and he is stupidly lucky/unlucky. Sure, he goes through many life and death tribulations, but in this story, there are occasions where MC suddenly has a plot device to rescue him from complete death; it's not a story that's meant to be taken too seriously.
* **Why you should read it**: It is very funny and it brings a smile to my face when I think about all the silly things that happens in this series. The beginning's a little slow (yes, you spend the first 10 manga chapters reading text messages in the chat group) and the MC is just stupidly lucky (or unlucky?) but it's really good, addictive even.
* **Tidbit**: There's way too many things that make this memorable.

#### Kaguya-sama: Love is War (Seinen romcom) (Score: 9.5/10 (+5))
* **Synopsis**: high school life where two try to make the other confess
* **Genre**: romcom, seinen
* **Release rate:** Completed
* **Why you should read it:** 
  * This is a genuinely funny manga that has even been adapted into an anime (I can't believe it's getting a season 3). Arguably a masterclass in romcoms. Each character, even the side-characters, are involved in the story, common romcom tropes are toyed with and there is consistent plot progression. 
  * In the later chapters of the story as it transitions from a less comedic manga and starts introducing more drama to wrap the story up, some parts of the plot feel forced; some characters are tied into the story in unnecessary ways. There are various plot points that are kind of weak, and it lessens the enjoyment somewhat. (minor spoilers) For example, in chapter 239, the story talks about how the principal tests shirogane in chapter 20. While the story matches up, the principal's motive does not; shirogane & kaguya were not together yet, on what basis did he even think it was a good idea to test shirogane? Furthermore, why did he not give further tests? 
  * tbh I enjoyed the manga less after it transitioned to a more serious tone. But that's probably personal preference.
  * Overall still worth a read.
* **Tidbit**: o kawaii koto~

Started a page on manga so I can keep track of what I read. Note that this list only contains manga I've read *after* 2020 Oct.

## Manga personal preferences
* I read manga during my free time to relax, so that kinda affects my manga choices. Stressful genres like horror are usually not my cup of tea.
* I like reading comedy 
* I have a tendency to read romcoms
* I like believable stories.
  * I prefer stories that [evoke secondary belief](https://dianetibert.com/2019/10/25/j-r-r-tolkien-evoking-secondary-belief); that is, given the story's fictional (or non-fictional) setting, the story and characters' actions should be reasonably believable
  * I'm not really a fan of plot armor or improbably idealistic outcomes; If a tragedy is more likely to happen in a story, I'd rather it happened as opposed to a sudden plot twist that made things all good again (although most stories tend to twist it to the latter). I am aware that this is something that happens all the time in manga and manhwa, so I usually turn a blind eye to its occurence.
  * I don't really like harems, yuri or yaoi, even though they are not deal-breakers.
* I prefer certainty of continuation. I tend to avoid starting on series that are no longer being maintained (e.g. Vagabond). 
* I like plot progression / character development and I hate stagnation. I'd be dissatisfied if I read a few chapters in a row and come out thinking that the plot didn't progress / there was zero character development.
  
## Can you recommend a manga / manhwa for me to read?

Check the table of contents and start reading the reviews from the ones with the highest quality scores. If they have the same bonus score, the manga that is more to the right is my preference. 

My all-time favourites when it comes to comedy is Grand Blue and when it comes to romcoms it's Kaguya Love is War. I don't have a favourite shonen/action series because that genre is saturated with good stuff.

## Quality Scoring System

Manga on this page are scored by a base score plus a bonus score. As such, the total score can range from 1 to 15.

* **Base score**: 1-10 out of 10. This is a subjective value based on how much I like the manga. This is usually at least a 7, otherwise I wouldn't have even bothered to pick up the manga (unless I read a highly rated manga and believe it to be overrated)
* **Bonus score:** wrapped in brackets, -2 to 5. Each score correlates to the level of "must-read" that I associate with it (elaborated upon below). I only add the manga which I believe can be considered readable on this page, so this bonus score is really meant to distinguish the "really good" and the "exceptionally good".
  * The possible scores are as follows:
    * -2 - Only worth reading if you need something to nibble on
    * -1 - Umm... The kind of manga where I'm kind of on the fence, which means you can do without reading it
    * 0 - Worth reading, but kind of forgettable... 
    * 1 - Highly worth reading, but some parts are kind of unsatisfactory, or I just don't feel attached to it for some unexplained reason
    * 2 - Definitely worth reading, I really liked it. Manga with +2 onwards are manga that I believe can be safely recommended to others who like the genre (if they don't mind the negative points brought up)
    * 3 - Read it!!! The kind where you think back about when you read it and it still warms your heart / makes you want to re-read 
    * 4 - Must read, the kind where you draw inspiration from the manga or are reminded of the manga in your life every now and then
    * 5 - Must read, if you're prepared to become addicted to it. The kind where you're so attached to the characters you start reading the original novel, or related fanfic/art/doujinshi.
* **Loopholes**: There are some manga where the base score is exceptional, but the bonus score isn't very high (e.g. That Girl is not just cute). This is because even though I like the series, I recognize it's not really impactful.

Manga are presented in ascending order of their quality score.

## Tidbits

Some manga are kinda unforgettable, and then some have this recurring joke or outstanding thing (good ones have multiple) that makes you immediately know what manga you're talking about when you mention it. I generally include the tidbit that most reminds me of the manga if I like it but can't remember what it's about. This may contain spoilers for the manga, so readers beware. The exception to this is when a manga is so good that you just won't forget about it, or so lack-lustre there's nothing worth bringing up.

#### The Stereotypical Life of a Reincarnated Lady (Romcom) (7/10 (-2))

* **Synopsis**: Woman reincarnates as noble lady
* **Genre**: romcom, manhwa
* **Release rate:** Weekly
* **Read until**: Ch 36
* **Should you read it**: I wouldn't really recommend it. So why is this manhwa on this list? I don't know. I just couldn't stop reading it to the end. It's not a *terrible* manhwa per se, but if you were to ask me what I liked about it, I wouldn't be able to give you an answer.

<TabItem value="a">

#### Tomo-chan wa Onnanoko (romcom) (10/10 (+0))

* **Synopsis**: A love story between a tomboy and a guy who are both ridiculously athletic
* **Genre**: romcom
* **Release rate**: Completed
* **Chapters**: 956, but most of them are just 1 page. Effectively ~60-65 chapters
* **+ve points**:
    * There's a lot more "show but don't tell" moments than other manga, partially because of it's structure
    * There are some really (rare) funny parts 471 472 505 793 801 832 868
* **-ve points**:
    * Clicking through the pages can be a pain
* **Should you read it**: Hm. Thinking back to this manga now I don't really have any outstanding memories of it. Don't get me wrong, it's got sweet and funny moments and it was kinda refreshing to read with its 1 page structure, but it's not terribly memorable. 
* **Tidbit**: This manga doesn't have a tidbit because I honestly don't remember any outstanding moments (aside from the confessions and the part where someone got angry)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='c'>

#### That Girl is not just cute (romcom) (9.5/10 (+0))

* **Synopsis**: A love story between a really unlucky boy and a strong girl who protects him.
* **Genre**: slice-of-life, romcom (cute, sweet, focus on friendships & romance)
* **Release rate**: Weekly
* **Read until**: Ch 85
* **+ve points**:
    * A lot of sweet and cute moments
    * For this type of genre, the consistent weekly update and quality is definitely a plus
    * The art is pretty high quality tbh, author loves to draw the female protag in various outfits. It's almost like a fashion show
* **Should you read it**: I would recommend it to people who like sweet manga and that slice-of-life BGR.
* **Tidbit**: Hachimatsu (  ´‿`)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='d'>

#### The Pharmarcy Where the Wolf Howls (Josei romcom) (9/10 (+0?))

* **Synopsis**: Pharmacist meets shunned celebrity from her childhood
* **Genre**: romcom, josei, manhwa
* **Release rate**: Weekly
* **Read until**: 35
* **Should you read it**: There's quite a lot of drama in this manhwa (although it's not between the main ship), so if you're not into that sort of thing I wouldn't recommend this. There are some funny parts, but unfortunately I don't find it very memorable (largely because the manhwa is still in its early stages).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="e">

#### Bakarina (Harem Comedy) (8/10 (+0))

* **Synopsis**: "My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!" That's right, the name of the manga is the synopsis
* **Genre**: comedy, harem
* **Release rate**: Irregular
* **Read until**: 31
* **Points**:
    * Very dense MC
    * Everyone noteworthy will fall hopelessly in love with the MC and devote their lives to her. This could get dry real quick
    * The release rate for the manga sucks. The anime adaptation was quite well done.
* **Should you read it**: It's a nice manga and the anime was quite well-done. The main appeal of this manga is that it loves to pull off ironic situations. The harem thing gets stale quite easily though and the characters are currently kinda skin-deep in general. There's some tension when characters get into potentially dangerous situations, but with this kind of manga you don't have to worry too much.
* **Tidbit**: Did you know the pet name for this manga is Bakarina? It is quite easy to guess why..

<TabItem value='b'>

#### Wotakoi (Josei slice-of-life romcom) (9/10 (+1))

* **Synopsis**: otakus
* **Genre**: slice-of-life, romcom (focus on romance)
* **Setting**: salarymen / women, working life
* **Release rate**: Monthly
* **Read until**: Ch 63
* **Points**: 
    * Plot is all about the 6 main characters
    * Mostly on sweet / romance moments rather than "HAHAHA" funny (although there are some funny moments)
    * Some chapters (esp. the earlier ones) make a lot of references to popular otaku culture
      * These are usually explained in TL notes
      * That said, if you are someone who enjoys that type of material, you'll likely enjoy these kinds of references
    * Limited drama and tribulations, if you're into that sort of thing
    * Abit cliche; all (initial) main characters are of different blood type groups 
    * Author loves to interact with his readers, so there's even some chapters where he draws fan-submitted situations of the characters. Although, at that point, the manga gives off doujin vibes rather than an actual manga...
* **-ve points**:
  * Sometimes uses lazy character development; telling instead of showing. e.g. manga becomes a slideshow of how each character would do something e.g. peel tangerines in Ch24 as opposed to *revealing* that fact through storytelling by putting them in a scenario that brings out how they would peel tangerines (e.g. characters come together for a party, and they react to Hirotaka peeling tangerines). 
  * Sometimes splits the story into multiple unstated timelines (e.g. Ch 53 and 53.5) where the chronological order is uncertain. This is makes the manga's chronology very messy. The weaker timeline ends up feeling like a spin-off, and the sum of the two parts is weaker than what it would've been if it were presented in chronological order a whole.
  * The otaku aspect gets a little stale after awhile. I'd prefer to see more facets of the characters (e.g. reactions to unexplored content for example)
  * Yeah as you might guess the plot isn't super deep but it does have some flitting food for thought moments
* **Should you read it**: If you like stories that give you diabetes and you enjoy reading about otakus hanging out. For all its shortcomings, I personally found this a pretty good read, and the initial part of the manga is a pretty good hook.
* **Tidbit**: Flat-chested Narumi

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="a">

#### Horimiya (Slice-of-life romcom) (9/10 (+1))

* **Synopsis**: A wholesome slice-of-life story with a loner and a popular girl and their friends
* **Genre**: slice-of-life / romcom (mostly slice of life with some sweet romantic moments)
* **Setting**: high-school / family
* **Release rate**: Monthly (irregular)
* **Read until**: Can't remember
* **Special Note**: I come back to this manga every few years to catch up
* **+ve points**:
    * although it's called horimiya, everyone is involved in the slice-of-life manga (although main couple gets the spotlight)
* **Points**:
    * I call this slice-of-life because there are a lot of filler chapters, limited plot progression (yes you *literally* wait irl years for the plot (if there is any) to progress), but the characters and relationships are fleshed out.
    * Horimiya actually involves their relationship with their family (in particular the Hori family) which can be kinda refreshing for a romcom
* **-ve points:**
    * some of the characters look too similar at the start so it's easy to mix up iura-kun
* **Should you read it**: Hmmm. I'd say yes if you want a manga to read and kinda just chill. It's got that calming / soothing vibe to it since a lot of the scenes are at the Hori household. I don't recommend getting too attached because of how slow it is.
* **Disclaimer**: That said, the story progresses very slowly (if ever) after ~ chapter 37 or so, hence I call it slice-of-life because you've probably retired by the time they graduate
* **Tidbit**: [SPOILER] Hori likes being submissive uh...

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="c">

#### Chitra (Isekai Reverse Harem) (9/10, (+1))

* **Synopsis**: Woman reborn in fantasy world and plays Civilization
* **Genre**: manhwa, isekai, reverse harem
* **Release rate**: Irregular
* **Read until**: Ch63
* **Points**:
  * Reverse harem is strong in this manhwa
  * Sometimes feels like The Gamer with all the game pop-ups and gachapon
  * Some parts of the manga feels kinda cringe, although I can't put my finger on the reason.
* **Should you read it**: It's not bad, but the update rate is a bit iffy..
* **Tidbit**: What does the rabbit eat?

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="g">

#### My Brother is From Deep Mountain (Slice-of-life) (9/10 +1)
* Ongoing
* **Summary**: A cute, relaxing and comedic slice-of-life fantasy manhwa about a sister who reunites with a brother she didn't even know of.


</TabItem>

<TabItem value="f">

#### Volcanic Age (Wuxia) (Score: 9/10, (+1))

* **Warning**: This manga triggered some readers due to its portrayal of Tibetan Buddhism
* **Synopsis**: MC experiences the same life again but with all of his knowledge
* **Genre**: Wuxia, manhwa
* **Release rate**: Weekly
* **Read until**: 72
* **Points**:
  * So far, this follows a classic "MC is so stupidly OP" plotline. Not surprising given the premise of MC being reborn with all his knowledge.
  * Some parts aren't very well translated (or the manhwa isn't very clear on what's actually happening / being conveyed, or the translators keep changing the names). This hinders the quality of the manhwa because you have to do guesswork on what is actually being said and what is actually happening.
  * Reader should have some prior knowledge about cultivation concepts (otherwise you might get a little lost about how he's powering up).
  * Characters, sects and names in general are poorly introduced (or at least, not memorably so). Sometimes you don't know who/what they are referring to.
  * Sometimes characters just disappear altogether from the location without any explanation on where they went.
  * Art isn't too bad; fight scenes are pretty solid.
* **Should you read it**: Hmm. It's a fun read if you don't mind the fact that the MC knows everything that happened in the future, and thus also knows all the secrets (and takes them for himself to become stupidly powerful). MC outclasses his enemies so much that you can count the number of times he gets injured with one hand and he's only lost once to a super OP elder.

<TabItem value="a">

#### Jitsu Wa Watashi Wa (Romcom) (Score: 9/10 (+2))

* **Synopsis**: A high-school love story between a human and a vampire; expect lots of other weird entities too.
* **Genre**: romcom (funny & touching, focus on comedy, friendships, love, discrimination and long-term perserverance)
* **Setting**: high school
* **Release rate**: Completed
* **Chapters**: 196
* **+ve Points:**
    * Many funny moments to the point where some serious moments get interrupted by funny moments
    * The manga has a lot of twists and turns which keep it fresh (caveat is you know everything is going to be okay in the end)
    * A lot of highs and lows, the emotional parts of the manga are good 
    * Doesn't only focus on the MC, also wraps up (most) loose ends for other side characters and closes the story relatively well
    * Big-brain author pulling off foreshadowing and time-travel
* **Points**:
    * Art style is a little unlike other manga
    * Quite a lot of fanservice (there is literally a character called the "Charismatic Pervert")
    * Some parts have excessive fanservice
* **-ve Points:**
    * Some parts can be a bit too random / weird
    * May have to trudge through the first few chapters
    * Some parts can be a bit too idealistic
    * There's quite a lot of filler
    * [SPOILER] MC gets a harem forced on him (arbitrary reasons as to why so many like him... seriously, *why*?)
    * The way tension is defused in the manga can get abit repetitive over time
    * Some side characters don't really get fleshed out, can feel a little shallow at times
    * [SPOILER] Shirou literally gets zero character development which is honestly such a waste of potential
    * Has a tendency to flesh out a character in 1 arc, then just toss them aside for the rest of the story
* **Should you read it:** Some parts feel a little draggy, but in general worth reading; truly a rollercoaster of emotions. I didn't really appreciate this manga while I was reading it, but thinking back, I think it was quite funny in general.
* **Will I re-read it:** Probably not, there's too many fillers, but some parts are legit hilarous
* **Tidbit**: ( ⚆ _ ⚆ ) ( ⚆ _ ⚆ ) when they find out what sucking blood really means to vampires

<TabItem value="g">

#### I'm a spider, so what? (Reincarnation action seinen) (9/10 (+2))
* **Synopsis**: Girl reincarnates as spider
  * Similar to Slime Rimuru plot, but a lot more gruesome and interaction with humans comes at a much later stage.
* **Genre**: action, seinen
* **Release rate**: Monthly
* **Points**:
  * MC undergoes tremendous suffering and has plot armor. 
* **Should you read it:** Art quality is exceptional and it is exciting to read. Unfortunately, the release rate is slow as hell for the manga (like Slime Rimuru) and it feels like a Slime Rimuru alternate universe with all the exposition into monster skills and how overpowered the MC grows. Also very lacking in proper social interaction (the author literally creates a skill so that MC can split her consciousness to talk to multiple mental copies of herself); for the entire manga so far you can count with one hand the number of (proper) conversations the MC has had with other creatures.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="f">

#### Bokuben (9/10 +2)
* Ongoing (soon to be completed)
* **Summary**: Trashy romcom
* **Worth reading**: A lot of filler / fanservice throughout the story. An enjoyable read, but like I said it's a pretty trashy romcom; a guilty pleasure. Some characters don't get enough justice.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="d">

#### Leveling Up by only Eating (9/10 (+2))
* **Synopsis**: MC who can't stop eating plays a realistic VR MMORPG so that he won't get fatter
* **Genre**: manhwa, shonen, slice-of-life, VR, food
* **Release rate**: Unknown (new manhwa)
* **Read until**: 49
* **Points**:
  * If you're someone who used to play MMORPGs you might find this manhwa rather nostalgic. I reminisced about my time playing Runescape while reading this manhwa.
  * This manhwa *really* focuses on food, so you might get hungry while reading. HAHA
  * The game world really revolves around our MC; there's literally a secret class specially for people who love to eat in the game, and he is a magnet for (non-romantic) NPC affection who are tired of players who just want to rank up.
* **Should you read it**: Personally, I found it enjoyable and at times funny to read. It's action packed, but also no stress because it's all a VR and you know the MC will pull through (even though he cares more about eating than anything else) It's quite lighthearted.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="b">

#### The Undefeatable Swordsman (Action) (Score: 9/10, (+2?))
* **Synopsis**: MC is very badass
* **Genre**: manhwa, shonen
* **Setting**: Feudal times, Korea, martial arts, Taoism 
* **Release rate**: Irregular
* **Read until**: Ch38
* **Points**:
  * The story still feels kinda young, it's only completed like maybe 1-2 story arcs
  * SPOILER-ISH: MC becomes pretty damn OP pretty quick, like maybe even abit too quick tbh
    * SPOILER-ISH: I'm honestly expecting the MC to fall to the dark side somewhere down the road because of how fast he is going
* **Should you read it**: It's still too early to draw conclusions on the quality of this manhwa as it's only at around 38 chapters. So far, so good.

#### Sijin (Drama Tragedy) (Score: 9/10, (+2))
* **Synopsis**: Woman relives her life with all her knowledge
* **Genre**: manhwa, romcom?, drama, revenge, schemes, tragedy
* **Release rate**: Weekly
* **Points**:
  * [BIG SPOILERS FROM FINISHED NOVEL]: 49f0bad299687c62334182178bfd75d8 7f021a1415b86f2d013b2618fb31ae53. Still, it's not too bad because the story is implied to 0663b8af9df17b966dc2116a2a4ce571 with less 21c3a46e069cdaac3ea89bd54449edaf.
    * Use MD5 decryptor to see the spoilers.
* **Should you read it**: The story is less like manga / manhwa and more of chinese drama with all the tragedy, scheming and plotting. It's a read I found hard to put down.

#### We May Be An Inexperienced Couple But... (Seinen romcom) (Score: 9/10, (+2))
* **Warning**: M18+ content
* **Synopsis**: Married life with a lot of emphasis on doing the putting it in and taking it out at the start
* **Genre**: romcom, seinen, slice-of-life
* **Release rate**: Weekly
* **Read until**: 59
* **Should you read it**: Some parts are borderline hentai (even when censored), so if you're not into that sort of thing I don't recommend this at all. If you're okay with that sort of thing, it's a pretty sweet romance manga with decent story progression and sometimes talks about adult life stuff (that isn't necessarily M18). Not a lot of drama, and it eventually wanes off a lot of that sexual tension and starts going into slice-of-life.

#### Oresama Teacher (Shojo Romcom) (Score: 9.5/10 (+3))
* **Synopsis**: Delinquent girl turns a new leaf (?) when she changes school 
* **Genre**: shojo, romcom (focus on comedy)
* **Release rate**: Irregular
* **Read until**: 155
* **Fav chapter**: probably 72 lol really made me burst out loud
* **+ve points:**
    * the facial expressions are on point and the humor is quite good
* **Points**:
    * [SPOILER-ISH] I didn't expect her to slowly form a reverse harem lol.. Then again, this is a shojo
    * Don't expect in-depth romance. Any romance is usually touch & go, unrequited or just really close friendships kinda thing.
* **Should you read it:** I'd recommend it. It consistently delivers on the humor. The plot sometimes feels kinda shallow (e.g. everyone turns out to be a good guy in the end kinda vibes), and sometimes it's not too hard to guess the plot, but honestly it's pretty good.
* **Other notes:** I give this a +2 even though I'm not in a discord server dedicated to this manga (this manga is simply not popular enough to have an active server)
* **Tidbit**: Usa-chan Man!

#### Kimetsu No Yaiba (9.5/10 +3)
* Completed
* **Summary**: Humans using swords and mystical breathing techniques to kill demons. 
* **Worth reading**: Nice series, but repetitive progression (fight big bad, defeat big bad, find out that big bad has tragic past that turned him into a demon, repeat). Death of main cast is a very common theme.
  * Anime adaptation is really good. Like, **really** good.
  * Final fight scenes don't have enough people in the battle; feels like a 1v1 as opposed to army of demon slayers vs army of demons.
  * Ending feels rushed and it is very disappointing; feels like a plot cop out.

<TabItem value="b">

#### Kitsune Spirit (Shonen romcom) (Score: 10/10, (+3))
* **Synopsis**: A married couple in a world with supernatural creatures
* **Genre**: romcom (equal parts sweet and funny), shonen (yes, shonen. You'll see why. This can get dark real quick)
*** Release rate:** Weekly (but very short chapters)
* **Read until:** 101
* **Points**:
  * Some lewd moments
  * Like I said this can get dark quick
  * The chapters are a little short for a weekly
  * Starts off as romcom and then becomes shonen before going back to being a romcom again
* **Should you read it:** Not gonna lie, the characters, setting and story is kinda refreshing.
* **Tidbit**: No citeable tidbit... but this pair is so cute~~~! e.g. Ch 99

#### Mission: Yozakura Family (Shonen romcom) (Score: 10/10, (+3))
* **Synopsis**: You'll know after reading the first chapter haha (yes, it's a bit spoilerish to explain this)
* **Genre**: romcom, shonen
*** Release rate**: Weekly
* **Read until**: 58
* **Points**:
  * It follows your usual shonen manga storyline: MC meets new big bad, powers up, meets another new big bad and gets stronger etc. It's not boring, but just expect that sort of story.
  * The story's a little too skewed towards the success of the protagonists.
  * Gives me Hero Academia vibes.
  * Also gives me some Demon Slayer vibes. Death is a common topic in this manga.
* **Should you read it:** Yes. It's quite well-written. I like how the story progresses. Sure, sometimes when you read a chapter you get the "Oh, this chapter is going to be about elaborating about this guy's personality" and such but I think overall it's well put together.

#### Peerless Dad (Action) (Score: 10/10 (+4))
* **Synopsis**: A father and his children
* **Genre**: Action, martial arts (wuxia), slice-of-life, manhwa
* **Release rate**: Weekly
* **Chapters**: 151
* **Points**: 
  * Some of the characters (and the story in general) is really quite well-written.
  * It's a pretty fresh story with a family-oriented MC. This is a MC who prefers to do guard work because he wants to spend more time with his kids.
  * MC also has quite a few secrets to unveil about his past and his master.
  * I love the character interactions.
  * The story can get dark. Tragedy is a common theme.
* **-ve points**:
  * [SPOILER]: A lot of references to another manga (red storm?) which I don't know anything about. 
* **Should you read it**: Well worth the read. It's a shame I read it so fast, because now I have to wait... Urrrgghh

#### Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet (Romcom) (Score: 10/10 (+4))
* **Synopsis**: A love story between two people from opposing countries in the same school.
* **Genre**: romcom (cute, sweet, funny, focus on friendships, love, discrimination and perserverance)
* **Setting**: high school
* **Release rate**: Completed
* **Chapters**: 119
* **+ve points:**
    * Very good pacing and progression of the story, length feels just right
    * Many funny, cute and sweet moments
    * (Most) characters are fleshed out and have depth
    * While it is still idealistic (what do you expect from a romcom), it's much more grounded most than other romcoms
    * Pretty good closure: Doesn't just end at the school level, but story also resolves conflict at a country-level and progresses all the way to marriage
* **Points**
    * A lot of fanservice
    * Content Warning: 1st chapter has abit of a rape-ish situation (this is the only time this happens throughout the manga so can relax)
* **-ve points:**
    * Some characters just there for the comic relief after their character arc (if they get one), wasted potential
    * Some characters have unfulfilling/silly endings
* **Should you read it**: Very highly recommended. It is very satisfying to read from start to finish and I still get goosebumps thinking about it. Again, exceptional pacing of the manga. Absolutely outstanding work.
* **Will I re-read it**: Maybe
* **Tidbit**: Honestly the highlight is that fact that the two main characters keep having to pretend to be something they aren't makes this such an entertaining read

#### Grand Blue (Comedy) (Score: 10/10 (+4))
* **Synopsis**: A manga that is about diving but there is hardly any diving (and then proceeds to joke about that fact)
* **Genre**: comedy (funny, focus on friendships, there's some romance but it's not the focus imo)
* **Release rate**: Monthly (somewhat inconsistent)
* **Read until**: Ch 63
* **+ve points:**
    * One of the funniest (if not the funniest) manga I've ever read
    * It's got some serious moments too so it's not too bad but in general just non-stop funny
* **Points:**
    * Expect weird stuff to happen in Grand Blue, probably not for everyone
* **-ve points:**
    * Some parts feel abit too repetitive / dragged out / feels like the story is going nowhere
    * Some of the character faces look abit too similar
    * Unclear story direction after some point in the plot..?
* **Should you read it:** Must read!
* **Tidbit**: Oolong cha

#### Cultivation Chat Group (Xianxia Comedy) (Score: 9.5/10 (+5))
* **Synopsis**: Cultivation and martial arts in a modern world
* **Genre**: Xianxia, shonen, comedy
* **Release rate:** Weekly? (or maybe even every 3 days for the manhwa???)
* **Read until**: Ch 1432 (webnovel)
* **Points**:
  * The manhwa occasionally falls short in quality (hence the 9.5)
  * Definitely a very entertaining read and the story is kinda well-thought out, even though MC will often pull out heaven-defying plot devices and get heaven-defying benefits because of his insanely powerful connections.
  * One of the interest aspects of this series is to bring a refreshing twist to xianxia by injecting modern elements into it. So you have these amazing battles with qi, blades and magical treasures, but these cultivators also use technology like handphones and such (hence the name). That being said, the use of handguns and rifles (in the conventional sense) is rather limited.
  * Being a Chinese story, there are some very Chinese concepts (e.g. the concept of "face") and a couple of terms directly translated from Chinese e.g. (seek death / 找死)
  * MC has plot armor / plot everything (to the point where it almost becomes a joke) and he is stupidly lucky/unlucky. Sure, he goes through many life and death tribulations, but in this story, there are many occasions where MC suddenly has a plot device to rescue him from complete death; it's not a story that's meant to be taken too seriously.
* Why you should read it: It is very funny and it brings a smile to my face when I think about all the silly things that happens in this series. The beginning's a little slow (yes, you spend the first 10 manga chapters reading text messages in the chat group) and the MC is just stupidly lucky (or unlucky?) but it's really good, addictive even.
* **Tidbit**: There's way too many things that make this memorable.

* **Synopsis**: high school life where two try to make the other confess
* **Genre**: romcom, seinen
* **Release rate:** Weekly
* **Read until**: 200+. Re-reading process suspended.
* **Why you should read it:** This is a masterclass in romcoms. Each character, even the side-characters, are involved in the story, common romcom tropes are toyed with and there is consistent plot progression. 10/10, 5/5.
* **Tidbit**: o kawaii koto~
